0,Bart Simpson,Princess Nokia,"Rotten apple to the core
Damn, I been a fuck up
Getting picked for last in gym
I can't even do a lay up
Writing on my sneakers
Being sneaky with my teachers
Smoking weed under the bleachers
Cutting out and glueing pictures
Carrying my CD player
Sucking on a Now or Later
Sour Apple was the flavor
Scribbling on doodle paper
Trying hard to pay attention
But I have no real direction
So I say, ""yo, fuck this lesson""
Spark the leaf, my back is stressing
Who I am and where I'm headed
Cutting school and acting crazy
Foster care done got me crazy
Living with a crazy lady
Every day I'm always late
Puffin' on a skimpy j
Staying in my grandma house
Wasn't even far away
But I guess that's what I do
Making life more difficult for me and you
Ay caramba
Bart Simpson with the shits
Ay caramba, man, you can go and suck my dick
Skating down the street, being mischievous as shit
This as good as it gon get
Always cheat on yo tests
Don't you be like the rest
I ain't no teacher's pet
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
If that don't work then
Deny, deny, deny
Looking to my future is like looking at the sky
Inner city orphan with my hand in apple pie
A liar, a schemer, a cheater, I do it all
I used to switch schools each coming fall
I skipped all my classes and
Still managed to pass them all
Reading comics in forbidden planet
I go home to a place of fantasy outside my own
Always been a loner, never had a solid home
I really like Marvel 'cause characters look just like me
And women don't have roles that make them look too sexually
I lie a lot from getting beaten and put off food, I'm not eating
Eczema so bad I'm bleeding, but I smile and keep it cheesing
A nerdy girl with nymphomanic tendencies
Everyone's offended but nobody here offended me
90's mami dressing like Aaliyah, quite apparently
I'm heavy with the theory, I move with the groove
I'm Black like Shaolin, I tang with the Wu
Africa, my guy, with the bantu do
I'm stupid fucking crazy nuts, loose like a screw
See, I know my money, got raised by the Jews
I'm a New York Puerto Rican like a rough kinda dude
I'ma hit the barrio and eat some Spanish food
And sit in Central Park, I'm in a New York mood
Bart Simpson with the shits
Ay caramba, man, you can go and suck my dick
Skating down the street, being mischievous as shit
This as good as it gon get
Always cheat on yo tests
Don't you be like the rest
I ain't no teacher's pet"

I'm a shapeshifting bitch, you don't know who you loving
Better light you a candle
I heard the nighttime was black
And if you don't watch your step the greatest bitch will be back
I cast a circle in white and I can vanquish your spite
And if you hex me with hate then I'ma conjour the light
Your evil ways put no fight
I ain't no queen of the night
I'm a bruja, I'm a bruja, and I'ma dress in all white

3,Goat,Princess Nokia,"Hate to burst your bubble, bitch
I'm that weird girl that's runnin' shit
I'm a boss bitch runnin' big shit
Got a company, need a couple mil'
Ain't no rap talk, this my real life
And that's on God, I almost died twice
So I go 'head, and I get mine
And I cash checks, and I get fly
Pelle Pelle with the VB belt
Skinny jeans and a studded belt
I've been fly, never needed help
I been me, ain't nobody else
Skinny jeans and a pair of Vans
Pants sag 'til they hit my ass
Lit, lit, I'ma do my dance
Like a raver bitch goin' in a trance
Edru, I'm a skater boy
Anime and a lot of tours
MySpace, made a lot of noise
That's middle school and I'm actin' caught
Back of the class, they sending my ass
Roll up my skirt and they think that I'm fast
I got no ass and I got no titties
But all of your dudes, they hit me to hit me
Hold up a minute
You know I ain't did it
That is your man
And that ain't my business
So come for me different
You can make fun of me
But my bank account statement is somethin'
Is somethin', is somethin' to see
I've been down with the shits
The rap shit I do it, you bet
I ain't the best
But damn I'm the best
You might get hit
Or you might get checked
So don't disrespect
Or it will be hit for the neck
This shit is the illest
This that Scream 3, finna kill shit
I'm a rap boo and a misfit
And I throw 'bows in the moshpit
I bump bump that Gangsta Boo
That Loco, that La Chat
I respect that trill shit
And them OGs that really rap
I'm already back with some new shit
You Dionne and I'm clueless
I got my own movement
I do this, I move shit
I change rap forever, man
It's me who had the biggest plan
Ain't no average bitch, I've been the man
I've been the G.O.A.T, eatin' off the land
It's me who took the weirdo shit
To another level, and I'm killin' it
They ain't want me, that's beginnin-ish
Now I'm too hot and they suck my dick"

You and me
Socks on feet
Love my inner child
Kool-Aid smile
I been like this
For a while
Going into town
Gonna find a crowd
Right by the kids in the park with the style
Swing till it's dark
Hit the block
Run from the cops
Don't get knocked
By these ops
Fuck these cops
Fuck these cops
Fuck these cops
Looking for the fun
Can you blame me?
Like to make jokes
But they think that I'm crazy
I know I'm perfect the way that God has made me
And I thank my parents for the life they gave me
Have you told your parents that you love them lately?
I look like my mama in the 1980s
If I've been bad, well, please forgive me
I remember when my granny use to hit me
Public school and two thanksgivings
Purple corduroys with the matching ribbons
Lil' puffy jacket and the t-shirt gilded
Wake up in the morning
Look into the fridge
Grab some eggs out
Breakfast it is
I'm still a kid
But kids are fun
Nice cup of OJ
Orange and sun
Frying pan in my hand
Green eggs and some ham
Yes, I'm Sam I am
Yes, I'm Sam I am"

Dibble in this, and dibble in that
Get in his head like I am a brat
Play with his balls when he up to bat
Make daddy real proud like I'm Kyla Pratt
I'm taking a shower, he making the bed
When I leave the city, I leave him on read
Go get the next, like I get the bread
He coming with questions, I call him the Feds
He let me plead the fifth
'Cause he know this box a gift
Eating breakfast not at Tiff
When I curve him he get stiff
I go beast mode
Ball like free throw
Game like cheat code
Pounds like kilo

Shout out the Boricua girls who rock yaki ponytails
Big up to my Africans who braid, many hours spent
They own they own businesses and work while they care for kids
You know I love auntie girls with Sunday best bonnet curls
And love to my Asian chicks who make hair go straight as shit
I love how West Indies do, it's gossip with hair and food

Please do not ask me or any black or brown women if our hair is real or not
If it's a wig, a weave, extensions, braids, don't fuckin ask
It's very rude, it's extremely personal to be put on the spot like that
How we choose to wear our hair is our personal choice, ok?
We bought it, it's ours, so have some manners and keep your curiosity to yourself"

You must have time on your hands
'Cause all the time you been hatin'
I know you're mad that I'm famous
I know you're mad that I made it
When all the time you been hatin'
You could've turned into something
Sometimes it works out for people
Sometimes it really just doesn't
Don't do this shit to be famous
I do this shit 'cause I love it
I shot an arrow said ""Fuck it""
I took a chance, came from nothing

You have to rise up above it

This dude poured wine on my friend
I punched him straight in his shit
I got a real code of honor
That I take seriously

My revolution is soulful
I'm healing kids with my hands

Jer svako od njih dobro zna

i da je na njenom nivou

Kada prolazi, ona zna sta treba
da izludi ba svakog ko je gleda
Zavodi reda
i svaki dan je na bulevaru
jer za njega
ba sve ostavlja na stranu

Loline fajterke
slatke kao barbike
Kao niko drugi, one su glavne
lepe i opasne, bez ijedne mane

Dreamlover
Dreamlover, crazy lovin' Valentine
Dreamlover, dreamin' 'bout you all the time
Dreamlover, tell me that you're all mine
Dreamlover, I wake up with you on my mind
Keepin' me up all night, keeping me up all night
I'm up all night, 'cause you're keepin' me up all night
See you round most everyday my love
Just thinkin' of things, I just can't say, my love
Lyin' alone here in my bed tonight
Visions of you, float round in my head tonight
'cause I'm dreamin' of you everyday
So I'll write it all down in a letter today, my love
Just hopin' to find the right words to say, my love
Now when you open it up, you're gonna see inside
By reading the words, please dream about me tonight,
cause I'm dreamin' of you every day"
14,Mi Deseo,Marina,"Hay... Como quisiera que papa Dios me concediera un deseo
Hay. El de volver a mi tierra donde mi madre me espera
correr feliz por el campo como cuando era un niño.
Y asi poder escuchar el cantico de las aves
y ver la lluvia caer mojando el campo bendito.
Sentir el viento que sopla y el sol en cada mañana
Y yo con mi atarralla rodeando la orilla del rio.
Y cuando llegue la tarde con su tristeza infinita
entonare unas coplas la que mi abuelo cantaba.
Gracias te doy padre bueno
Gracias por darme la vida
Te ruego que cuando muera
me sepulten en mi tierra bendita.
Y asi termina mi canto con sabor a tierra mojada
es que aya en la quebrada se quedaron tristes recuerdos
A mi tierra volvere si papa Dios lo permite
Por que de aqui vengo yo y alli nace mi canto."
15,She Knows Youre Lyin,Marina,"She knows you're lyin', she knows you're lyin'
She knows you're lyin', she knows you're lyin'
She knows you're lyin', she knows you're lyin'
That's right
Ain't never gonna come a day
No matter what may come your way
That she won't know just when she's being lied to
Don't matter if you're here or there
She can follow you anywhere
No matter what you do she knows you're lyin'
Don't matter if you scream and shout
She knows what you're about
Now don't you have no doubt
She knows you're lyin'
Your love's just the cheatin kind
You never waste much time
Now she knows every sign, she knows you're lyin'
She knows you're lyin', she knows you're lyin'
She knows you're lyin', and what you're about
She knows you're lyin, she knows you're lyin'
She knows you're lyin',
She knows just what you're all about
Yeah"
16,Soft To Be Strong,Marina,"I know it's hard to be soft
I know it hurts to be kind
I know that when love is lost
It's only fear in disguise
And I guess I've known it all along
The truth is you have to be soft to be strong
Finally I feel the fear is gone
I found out love has to be soft to be strong
Soft to be strong
Soft
I believe the world is beautiful
Only the weak ones are cruel
I choose to love you without fear
No shame in being sincere
And I guess I've known it all along
The truth is you have to be soft to be strong
Finally I feel the fear is gone
I found out love has to be soft to be strong
Soft to be strong
And I made myself believe other people wanted to hurt me
Took my bitterness and made it sweet
I took a broken heart and made it beat
Somebody hurt me long ago
And though to heal a heart is slow
It's just a consequence of pain
There is no use in laying blame
And I guess I've known it all along
The truth is you have to be soft to be strong
Finally I feel the fear is gone
I found out love has to be soft to be strong
Soft to be strong
Soft to be strong
Soft to be strong
Soft"
