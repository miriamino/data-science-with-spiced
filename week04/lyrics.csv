0,Bart Simpson,Princess Nokia,"Rotten apple to the core
Damn, I been a fuck up
Getting picked for last in gym
I can't even do a lay up
Writing on my sneakers
Being sneaky with my teachers
Smoking weed under the bleachers
Cutting out and glueing pictures
Carrying my CD player
Sucking on a Now or Later
Sour Apple was the flavor
Scribbling on doodle paper
Trying hard to pay attention
But I have no real direction
So I say, ""yo, fuck this lesson""
Spark the leaf, my back is stressing
Who I am and where I'm headed
Cutting school and acting crazy
Foster care done got me crazy
Living with a crazy lady
Every day I'm always late
Puffin' on a skimpy j
Staying in my grandma house
Wasn't even far away
But I guess that's what I do
Making life more difficult for me and you
Ay caramba
Bart Simpson with the shits
Ay caramba, man, you can go and suck my dick
Skating down the street, being mischievous as shit
This as good as it gon get
Always cheat on yo tests
Don't you be like the rest
I ain't no teacher's pet
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
If that don't work then
Deny, deny, deny
Looking to my future is like looking at the sky
Inner city orphan with my hand in apple pie
A liar, a schemer, a cheater, I do it all
I used to switch schools each coming fall
I skipped all my classes and
Still managed to pass them all
Reading comics in forbidden planet
I go home to a place of fantasy outside my own
Always been a loner, never had a solid home
I really like Marvel 'cause characters look just like me
And women don't have roles that make them look too sexually
I lie a lot from getting beaten and put off food, I'm not eating
Eczema so bad I'm bleeding, but I smile and keep it cheesing
A nerdy girl with nymphomanic tendencies
Everyone's offended but nobody here offended me
90's mami dressing like Aaliyah, quite apparently
I'm heavy with the theory, I move with the groove
I'm Black like Shaolin, I tang with the Wu
Africa, my guy, with the bantu do
I'm stupid fucking crazy nuts, loose like a screw
See, I know my money, got raised by the Jews
I'm a New York Puerto Rican like a rough kinda dude
I'ma hit the barrio and eat some Spanish food
And sit in Central Park, I'm in a New York mood
Bart Simpson with the shits
Ay caramba, man, you can go and suck my dick
Skating down the street, being mischievous as shit
This as good as it gon get
Always cheat on yo tests
Don't you be like the rest
I ain't no teacher's pet"

I'm a shapeshifting bitch, you don't know who you loving
Better light you a candle
I heard the nighttime was black
And if you don't watch your step the greatest bitch will be back
I cast a circle in white and I can vanquish your spite
And if you hex me with hate then I'ma conjour the light
Your evil ways put no fight
I ain't no queen of the night
I'm a bruja, I'm a bruja, and I'ma dress in all white

3,Goat,Princess Nokia,"Hate to burst your bubble, bitch
I'm that weird girl that's runnin' shit
I'm a boss bitch runnin' big shit
Got a company, need a couple mil'
Ain't no rap talk, this my real life
And that's on God, I almost died twice
So I go 'head, and I get mine
And I cash checks, and I get fly
Pelle Pelle with the VB belt
Skinny jeans and a studded belt
I've been fly, never needed help
I been me, ain't nobody else
Skinny jeans and a pair of Vans
Pants sag 'til they hit my ass
Lit, lit, I'ma do my dance
Like a raver bitch goin' in a trance
Edru, I'm a skater boy
Anime and a lot of tours
MySpace, made a lot of noise
That's middle school and I'm actin' caught
Back of the class, they sending my ass
Roll up my skirt and they think that I'm fast
I got no ass and I got no titties
But all of your dudes, they hit me to hit me
Hold up a minute
You know I ain't did it
That is your man
And that ain't my business
So come for me different
You can make fun of me
But my bank account statement is somethin'
Is somethin', is somethin' to see
I've been down with the shits
The rap shit I do it, you bet
I ain't the best
But damn I'm the best
You might get hit
Or you might get checked
So don't disrespect
Or it will be hit for the neck
This shit is the illest
This that Scream 3, finna kill shit
I'm a rap boo and a misfit
And I throw 'bows in the moshpit
I bump bump that Gangsta Boo
That Loco, that La Chat
I respect that trill shit
And them OGs that really rap
I'm already back with some new shit
You Dionne and I'm clueless
I got my own movement
I do this, I move shit
I change rap forever, man
It's me who had the biggest plan
Ain't no average bitch, I've been the man
I've been the G.O.A.T, eatin' off the land
It's me who took the weirdo shit
To another level, and I'm killin' it
They ain't want me, that's beginnin-ish
Now I'm too hot and they suck my dick"

You and me
Socks on feet
Love my inner child
Kool-Aid smile
I been like this
For a while
Going into town
Gonna find a crowd
Right by the kids in the park with the style
Swing till it's dark
Hit the block
Run from the cops
Don't get knocked
By these ops
Fuck these cops
Fuck these cops
Fuck these cops
Looking for the fun
Can you blame me?
Like to make jokes
But they think that I'm crazy
I know I'm perfect the way that God has made me
And I thank my parents for the life they gave me
Have you told your parents that you love them lately?
I look like my mama in the 1980s
If I've been bad, well, please forgive me
I remember when my granny use to hit me
Public school and two thanksgivings
Purple corduroys with the matching ribbons
Lil' puffy jacket and the t-shirt gilded
Wake up in the morning
Look into the fridge
Grab some eggs out
Breakfast it is
I'm still a kid
But kids are fun
Nice cup of OJ
Orange and sun
Frying pan in my hand
Green eggs and some ham
Yes, I'm Sam I am
Yes, I'm Sam I am"

Dibble in this, and dibble in that
Get in his head like I am a brat
Play with his balls when he up to bat
Make daddy real proud like I'm Kyla Pratt
I'm taking a shower, he making the bed
When I leave the city, I leave him on read
Go get the next, like I get the bread
He coming with questions, I call him the Feds
He let me plead the fifth
'Cause he know this box a gift
Eating breakfast not at Tiff
When I curve him he get stiff
I go beast mode
Ball like free throw
Game like cheat code
Pounds like kilo

Shout out the Boricua girls who rock yaki ponytails
Big up to my Africans who braid, many hours spent
They own they own businesses and work while they care for kids
You know I love auntie girls with Sunday best bonnet curls
And love to my Asian chicks who make hair go straight as shit
I love how West Indies do, it's gossip with hair and food

Please do not ask me or any black or brown women if our hair is real or not
If it's a wig, a weave, extensions, braids, don't fuckin ask
It's very rude, it's extremely personal to be put on the spot like that
How we choose to wear our hair is our personal choice, ok?
We bought it, it's ours, so have some manners and keep your curiosity to yourself"

You must have time on your hands
'Cause all the time you been hatin'
I know you're mad that I'm famous
I know you're mad that I made it
When all the time you been hatin'
You could've turned into something
Sometimes it works out for people
Sometimes it really just doesn't
Don't do this shit to be famous
I do this shit 'cause I love it
I shot an arrow said ""Fuck it""
I took a chance, came from nothing

You have to rise up above it

This dude poured wine on my friend
I punched him straight in his shit
I got a real code of honor
That I take seriously

My revolution is soulful
I'm healing kids with my hands

Jer svako od njih dobro zna

i da je na njenom nivou

Kada prolazi, ona zna sta treba
da izludi ba svakog ko je gleda
Zavodi reda
i svaki dan je na bulevaru
jer za njega
ba sve ostavlja na stranu

Loline fajterke
slatke kao barbike
Kao niko drugi, one su glavne
lepe i opasne, bez ijedne mane

Miscellaneous
Dreamlover
Dreamlover, crazy lovin' Valentine
Dreamlover, dreamin' 'bout you all the time
Dreamlover, tell me that you're all mine
Dreamlover, I wake up with you on my mind
Keepin' me up all night, keeping me up all night
I'm up all night, 'cause you're keepin' me up all night
See you round most everyday my love
Just thinkin' of things, I just can't say, my love
Lyin' alone here in my bed tonight
Visions of you, float round in my head tonight
'cause I'm dreamin' of you everyday
So I'll write it all down in a letter today, my love
Just hopin' to find the right words to say, my love
Now when you open it up, you're gonna see inside
By reading the words, please dream about me tonight,
cause I'm dreamin' of you every day"
14,Mi Deseo,Marina,"Hay... Como quisiera que papa Dios me concediera un deseo
Hay. El de volver a mi tierra donde mi madre me espera
correr feliz por el campo como cuando era un niño.
Y asi poder escuchar el cantico de las aves
y ver la lluvia caer mojando el campo bendito.
Sentir el viento que sopla y el sol en cada mañana
Y yo con mi atarralla rodeando la orilla del rio.
Y cuando llegue la tarde con su tristeza infinita
entonare unas coplas la que mi abuelo cantaba.
Gracias te doy padre bueno
Gracias por darme la vida
Te ruego que cuando muera
me sepulten en mi tierra bendita.
Y asi termina mi canto con sabor a tierra mojada
es que aya en la quebrada se quedaron tristes recuerdos
A mi tierra volvere si papa Dios lo permite
Por que de aqui vengo yo y alli nace mi canto."
15,She Knows Youre Lyin,Marina,"She knows you're lyin', she knows you're lyin'
She knows you're lyin', she knows you're lyin'
She knows you're lyin', she knows you're lyin'
That's right
Ain't never gonna come a day
No matter what may come your way
That she won't know just when she's being lied to
Don't matter if you're here or there
She can follow you anywhere
No matter what you do she knows you're lyin'
Don't matter if you scream and shout
She knows what you're about
Now don't you have no doubt
She knows you're lyin'
Your love's just the cheatin kind
You never waste much time
Now she knows every sign, she knows you're lyin'
She knows you're lyin', she knows you're lyin'
She knows you're lyin', and what you're about
She knows you're lyin, she knows you're lyin'
She knows you're lyin',
She knows just what you're all about
Yeah"
16,Soft To Be Strong,Marina,"I know it's hard to be soft
I know it hurts to be kind
I know that when love is lost
It's only fear in disguise
And I guess I've known it all along
The truth is you have to be soft to be strong
Finally I feel the fear is gone
I found out love has to be soft to be strong
Soft to be strong
Soft
I believe the world is beautiful
Only the weak ones are cruel
I choose to love you without fear
No shame in being sincere
And I guess I've known it all along
The truth is you have to be soft to be strong
Finally I feel the fear is gone
I found out love has to be soft to be strong
Soft to be strong
And I made myself believe other people wanted to hurt me
Took my bitterness and made it sweet
I took a broken heart and made it beat
Somebody hurt me long ago
And though to heal a heart is slow
It's just a consequence of pain
There is no use in laying blame
And I guess I've known it all along
The truth is you have to be soft to be strong
Finally I feel the fear is gone
I found out love has to be soft to be strong
Soft to be strong
Soft to be strong
Soft to be strong
Soft"

And everyday, we're survivors
So forget the day, it's all about tonight
Act a fool and start a riot, a riot be rebel
Bottles poppin' 'til we can't stand

Gonna live like it's the end of the world
Gonna party like, oh
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up
It ain't the end of the world
Similes, metaphors and we pop pills
Sick flow, inundated with the doc bills
Work hard, now we know how to top bills
In the middle of the street doing cartwheels
Lot of them try to do it but it's not real
Wasn't a rapper, then I could've got a pop deal
White curls in a hot-pink Hot Wheels
Lot of bottles and a lot of fruity cocktails
Uh, days of our lives
You wink it goes by
So we'll just get it with no Edison
Anything goes, so no time for closed minds
And free my Lil' Weezy
And let's just get right
Young Money, Cash Money in the building
Let's go, the world ends tonight
Have a drink with me and let's make tonight go down
In history, in history, yeah
Let's play make believe it's the last 24 hours
And this whole world is ours eternally, eternally
Hey, bottles poppin' 'til we can't stand
We keep it rockin' till 6 a.m.
New York to London, over to Japan
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up
We gonna party like, party like it's the end of the world
We gonna party like, like it's 2012
You know that it doesn't matter as long as we got each other
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up, it ain't the end of the world, oh
We gonna live like it's the end of the world
Gonna party like, oh
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up

Anything that they say any more
And it's never too late to start over
So lets start it with here right now
We gonna party like, party like it's the end of the world
We gonna party like, like it's 2012
You know that it doesn't matter as long as we got each other
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up, it ain't the end of the world, oh
We gonna live like it's the end of the world
Gonna party like, oh
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up
It ain't the end of the world, the world
Because the world keeps spinnin'
The world keeps spinnin' around"
19,5 Star Chick,Nicki Minaj,"(Nicki Minaj)
I just had a epiphany,
I need to go to Tiffany's
Fendi on my slippers,
And my cookies always slippery
I don't need help,
I pay the bills on time
So I be yellin ""fuck'em""
With a dildo sign
Five little mama, you a Three star
I aint sleepin when
I say I'm in my dream car
Oh did I stutta?
Harajuku hyphen,
Barbie... I'm hot
I think it's time to put the rice in
I was in the chair,
I was gluing my weave in
When you hit the stage
They was booin and leavin
Young money red flag,
No more auditions
Ask Lil Wayne who the 5 star bitch is!"

22,All Things Go,Nicki Minaj,"Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent
I put the heat in vents, man I been competin' since
I look beyond what people sayin', and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher, what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there will never be a sequel
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful
As long as 7 years from now, I'm taking my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was '06
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I look down, yes I suppose
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'mma ride I'm with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
We know, we know, say fuck the world, we ridin' til the end
When all is said and done, look at what we've become
I just want you to know, that I did it for you
I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?
Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know that I love him
Family ties broken before me, niggas trynna kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me, yes I get it, I get it, it was all me
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes, the last day he saw me
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'mma ride I'm with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
We know, we know, say fuck the world, we ridin' til the end
When all is said and done, look at what we've become
I just want you to know, that I did it for you
Let me make this clear I'm not difficult, I'm just about my business
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact
I'd give it all, if I could somehow, just rekindle that
She never understands, why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like, somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say ""We did it!""
My child with Aaron, would've have been sixteen, any minute
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah, is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Yeah we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writing, this is The Pinkprint
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'mma ride I'm with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
We know, we know, say fuck the world, we ridin' til the end
When all is said and done, look at what we've become
I just want you to know, that I did it for you"

25,Autobiography,Nicki Minaj,"This is the Autobiography of Nicki Maraj
May the lord protect me as the world gets hectic
My voice projected my life reflected
Daddy was a crack fiend
2 in the morning had us running down the street like a track team
When he burnt the house down n my mother was in it
How could I forget it the, pain infinite
Shes my queen and I ain't even British
Shes the only reason that I went to school and I finished
She told me that I had talent
Got on her knees and prayed for me when I started being violent
She saw something in me that, until this day I don't know if I could be dat
But I'm a die tryin and when I'm done cryin
Grab the iron
And black out like I'm retiring
Nightmares of you killing my mother
The reason that I sleep with my head under the covers
N shoulda thrown a book at
ch'you cause I hate you so much that it burn when I look at ch'you
May the lord protect me as the world gets hectic
my voice projected my life reflected
May the lord protect me as the world gets hectic
my voice projected my life reflected
Damn I wanna run to you
Hold you n kiss you tell you how I miss you
Thought I would have a son for you
But now it's official it's over and I can't let you go
But I gotta let you know all the shit
I did make it feel like I'm dyin real slow
cause no one understands me
they don't know what to do when I'm hurt when I'm angry
You was my friend and my man and my daddy
You was there when that bitch tried to stab me
anything I ever needed knew you had me
Cause of you all them chicks couldn't stand me
So why hurt you that's the question
It took this long for me to learn my lesson
Cause now all I want is peace and get drama
I finally understand the true meaning of karma
May the lord protect me as the world gets hectic
my voice projected my life reflected
May the lord protect me as the world gets hectic
my voice projected my life reflected
Please baby forgive me, mommy was young
mommy was to busy tryna have fun now
I pat myself on the back for sending you back
cause god knows I was better than that
To conceive then leave you the concept alone seems evil
I'm trapped in my concience
I adhear to the nonsense listened to people
who told me I wasn't ready for you
But how the fuck would they know wat I was ready to do
And of course it wasn't your fault
It's like I feel it in the air
I hear you sayin mommy don't cry can't you see I'm right here
I gotta let you know what you mean to me
When I'm sleeping I see you in my dreams with me
Wish I could touch your little face or just hold your little hand
If it's part of gods plan, maybe we can met again"

Yo, I employ these niggas
They be grown men, but I little-boy these niggas
Want the cookie, so I gotta Chips Ahoy these niggas
But I never iPhone, Android these niggas
Use rubbers with 'em, I don't never raw these niggas
More money than em', I'ma son all these niggas
I ain't shopping, but it's like I gotta store these niggas
Put em' on time-out and never call these niggas
Pussy like girls, damn, is my pussy gay?
It's a holiday- Play with my pussy day!
Pussy this, pussy that, pussy cakin'
Pussy ride dick like she a Jamaican
Pussy stay warm, pussy on vacation
You loose bitches need a pussy renovation
You can eat it with a pussy reservation
Pussy 'bout to get a standing ovation
Clap, clap, clap for this pussy, nigga
But I can't give this pussy to a pussy nigga
Aw man, slow down
I'ma give you somethin' that you could hold down
But I can't give you head, I'm too ill for that
I'ma make a movie still kill bill for that
'Cause what the fuck, this ain't Chanel, nigga, custom gown?
What the fuck, I ain't smokin' hot, bust me down?
You the same clown nigga that was runnin' me down?
Now you all up in the store 'cause you wanna be down?
I said, rule #1 to be a boss ass bitch:
Never let a clown nigga try to play you
If he play you, then rule #2:
Fuck his best friends, then make 'em yes-men
And get a dick pic, and then you press send
And send a red heart and send a kissy face
And tell him that his friends love how your pussy tastes
And that's rule #3, I'm the school T
My wrists look like I am a jewel thief
But that's just 'cause I am a boss bitch
Now macaroni cheese and grill my swordfish
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch
I'm a boss ass bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
I'm a boss ass bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
If he catch my drift, he could catch my jizz
I be out in Cali runnin' all my businesses
I be out in Cali watchin' back my Christmas vids
Every time I fuck him, yes I tell him this is his
Look down at it, and I said, ""This is big.""
And my game is so cold, I said, ""This is rigged.""
Best flow in the game, this is not a lie
Tell them bitches cross they t's and dot they I
I came back, bitches flows still boring
I said, ""Damn man, go back to whoring.""
You know I still lead the league in scoring
You know I'm still bad and I'm still foreign
I'ma give bitches time to get hot
Chill out at the game, New York, nigga buck
If they actually got bars, they could rock
But if not, I'ma destroy chicks a lot
But on the real, I'm album mode
Just dropped this freestyle 'fore these files get old
When I lay low, bitches be safe and sound
When I come back, they better not make a sound
I hear you!
When I'm back on the prowl,
You bitches better have my money
'Cause I'm coming for you!
Uh, okay, I order rich bitch sauce
Rich bitch cold, got a rich bitch cough
Which bitch want it? I'll go rich bitch off
'Cause you know my style gettin' bit ripped off!
When I'm at the restaurant, rich bitch sauce
Rich bitch cold, I got a rich bitch cough
Which bitch want it? I go rich bitch off
'Cause you know my style gettin' bit ripped off!
I'm a boss, I'm a boss

I'm just a bad bitch I'm sorry I put you through that
I'm from New York where we don't ever say ""Good morning""
Rippin' the block and he ain't come home till the morning
I always prayed to have a building with a doorman
Now I'm so busy I gotta turn down these endorsements
Now I'm flaunting everything that I wanted
Remember a time when I couldn't even afford it
Now I'm in stores I get everything that fits me
Chanel minc slides and shades so they don't know it's me

Drip too hard, got his dick too hard
He gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Pretty little toes stunting on these hoes
Buy another bag soon as I get paid
Bad little vibe, keep her by my side
Case a dirty bitch gotta catch this fade
Do it all the time, still I'm in my prime
Couple new blessings every time we pray

Uh, I'm still the same bitch from the city of the potholes
She say ""oh, I got those"", I said ""No, it's not those""
I don't fuck with birds but you bitches on my cock though
If I want some chicken and waffles I go to Roscoe's
Cooler than the winter but I heat up like the summer
Fuckin' with my baby I'm a gunna
When I say baby I ain't talkin' bout Stunna
I'm talking 'bout lil like Weezy on the come-up

Drip too hard, got his dick too hard
He gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Pretty little toes stunting on these hoes
Buy another bag soon as I get paid
Bad little vibe, keep her by my side
Case a dirty bitch gotta catch this fade
Do it all the time, still I'm in my prime
Couple new blessings every time we pray
Drip too hard, got his dick too hard
He gon' fuck around and drown
Pretty little toes stunting on these hoes
Buy another bag
Bad little vibe, keep up out my sight
Case a dirty bitch gotta catch this fade
Do it all the time, still I'm in my prime
Couple new blessings every time we pray

Couple new blessings every time we pray

I wanna get to know you
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of my lovin'
I'm simply going to drive you crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my lovin'
I'm really gonna drive you crazy

Im lovin' how you look in my eyes
Swingin' them hips when you pass
I'm visualizing my name tatooed on that ass baby
Jump on this Harley
Lets go smoke some of that Bob Marley
Sip some Bacardi
Then go pull up at the afterparty
I think we make a perfect couple
But you think I'm trouble
Maybe thats the reason you gave me the wrong number
She got me feeling like ""maybe she the wrong woman""
Think im'a be chasin' the chicken head you own somethin'
Your toes painted hair fixed all the time
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you
I betcha I have you doin' what you said that you won't do
Making decisions shorty good things don't last long
Your girlfriend keep showin' me that thong
Before I head home
Im'a stop at your house and blow the horn
If you come outside you know it's on (holla at your boy)


Bitches be frustrated with the baller
Wonder why I don't call her
Maybe because I'm busy and she needs someone to spoil her
It gets annoying from time to time I gotta ignore her
In order to let her know we'll be friends and nothing more
She loves it when I'm in town
Hate it when I'm not around
I get her and wear down
Next door neighbors hear the sound
Pictures hittin' the ground
Just enough to hold us down
I'm stickin' n' moving cruising after the third round
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
I can make a 40 year old feel like a young lady
I admit I fell in love with her frame
And to make her feel special I let her call me by my government name
Her panties wet over fame
Fall in love with my chain
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer would she remain
Surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only
I'm not your boyfriend I'm your homie.


(Yeah) What would fuck me up more
Watching her lick her lips
Or watching her walk she hypnotize me with her hips (yeah) man
I sweet talking her if she like
Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right right
Look I'm legit now used to break laws
Now you can reap the benefit of world tours
Big house big Benz girl it yours
Mink coats Italian shoes stones with no flaws
You ain't go to look like a model for me to adore you
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal
Don't Indulge in my past fuck what happened before you
Cause their be some homies gonna hate you that never saw you
Come here let my touch on you I let you touch on me
Put my tounge on you you put your tounge on me
Let me ride on you and you can ride on
We can do it all the night
We can have a balla tonight

I wanna get to know you
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my lovin'
I'm simply gonna drive you, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, lady
One dose of my lovin'

37,Beautiful Sinner,Nicki Minaj,"South Africa is where I come from
Get me my banjo, get me my drum
Kidnap career & don't take ransom
Don't let me come out of my dungeon
You want me to leave then take it down
You see me come out of England at dawn
You say the pattern come from Kingston
Trinidad Trinidad, my island
I see you in here dancing
Your preview is quite romantic
I envy your perfect kind of life
Who knew you'd be so sexy?
I think you're quite fantastic
Screw your flaws
You're perfect in my eyes
And maybe I'm naive for loving you
You're a cheat and a liar
But tonight you're everything I desire
You beautiful sinner
I love your wicked heart
Beautiful sinner
It's such a work of art
I didn't know that bad could look so good
You are the type of bad that feels so good
Beautiful sinner
I bet you're heart of stone
Living in your world alone
I hope you let me in tonight
They want me to beware
You're dangerous, I don't care
I can't wait to have you in my arms
And maybe I'm naive for loving you
You're a cheat and a liar
But tonight you're everything I desire
You beautiful sinner
I love your wicked heart
Beautiful sinner
It's such a work of art
I didn't know that bad could look so good
You are the type of bad that feels so good
You're a beautiful sinner
Maybe your the master of disguise
And you are put it on and
Your really the saint that could walk
Are you here to save me from the crowd?
If you are then baby take me now
You beautiful sinner
I love your wicked heart
Beautiful sinner
It's such a work of art
I didn't know that bad could look so good
You are the type of bad that feels so good

39,Bed Of Lies,Nicki Minaj,"Do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes
They only pretend, you would be mine
And you know how you made me, believe
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies
You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat
Balenciaga's on my boots with the python strap
You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before, I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, man you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'
Cause I was doing it for us, I told em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating
Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along
I'mma ask on the song
Do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes
They only pretend, you will be mine
And you know how you made me, believe
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice em
If you had a heart, I was hoping you would've showed it some
What the fuck you really telling me, what you telling me
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along
I'mma ask on the song
So does she know I've been in that bed before
A thousand count, and not a single threaded truth
If I was just another girl
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me, when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself
Do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes
They only pretend, you will be mine
And you know how you made me, believe
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies"

And now we murderers because we kill time
I knock her lights out and she still shine
I hate to see her go but I love to watch her leave
But I keep her running back and forth like a soccer team
Cold as a winter day, hot as a summer's eve
Young Money thieves, steal your love and leave
I like the way you walk and if you walking my way
I'm that Red Bull, now let's fly away
Let's buy a place with all kind of space
I let you be the judge and I'm the case

And I just be coming off the top as bestest
I love your sushi roll, hotter than wasabi
I race for your love, shake and bake Ricky Bobby
I'm at the W but I can't meet you in the lobby
Girl, I gotta watch my back 'cause I'm not just anybody
I seen 'em stand in line just to get beside her
I let her see the Aston and let the rest surprise her

She like tanning, I like staying in
She like romancing, I like rolling with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscious is
She watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN
But when that show end, she all on my skin
Lotion, slow motion, roller coasting like back forth, hold it
She pose like it's for posters and I poke like I'm supposed to
Take this photo if you for me, she said, ""Don't you ever show this""
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless, when I spoke this, she rejoiced it
Said your words get me open, so I closed it
Where your clothes is, I'm only loving for the moment
Uh, she ain't got a man but she's not alone
Miss Independent, yeah, she got her own
Hey gorgeous, I mean flawless, well, that's what you are
How I see it is how I call it, yeah
Look it how she walk, she know she bad
Do, do your thing, baby, I ain't even mad
And I ain't even fast, I'ma stay a while
Hold yo' head Chris, I'ma take her down
Oh baby, I be stuck to you like glue
Baby, wanna spend it all on you

But I shoulda listened to what momma told me
Furry moon boots, shades Dita
Too high to give a shit about PETA
Sativa so strong I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
New things for them to imitate
I'm a fukin' black barbie
Pretty face, perfect body
Pink seats in the 'Rari
Always fuck him like I'm sorry
Who the fuck is gon' protect her?
If I really gotta check her
Peter piper picked a pepper
And my cake is triple decker
No Flex Zone, No Flex Zone
(Yeah, oh no, no, no, no) No Flex Zone
I see these silly nigga's flexin', it's a no zone
You gon' be floatin' in dem rivers like you know Joan
Island girl, Donald Trump want me go home
Still pull up with my wrist lookin' like a snowcone
She said she got a hit record, I said ""Oooh shit!""
Picked up my phone cause I had to call ""Bullshit!""
These bitches havin' nightmares of my new shit
These bitches pussy and they don't ever do shit
Hahaha, get it? Douche it-...hahahahahahaha
Half a mili on the Maybach Pullman, bought it
Now I'm prayin' all my foreigns don't get deported
Niggas love me so much they be sendin' me gifts
And these clown niggas actin', I'mma send 'em some skits
Bitches can't rap for shit, I'mma send 'em some tips
All these bitches is my sons, should be suckin' my tits
(Yeah, oh no, no, no, no, yeah, oh no, no, no, no)
Now usually I don't do this, I'm Popeye, she's Brutus
Usually I'm a Christian but this peace is Buddhist
All of my niggas draw but none of them Cartoonists
Usually I'm the baddest, usually I'm the cutest
Usually I'm the flyest, usually you're the stewardess
And we ain't playin' ball but usually its some shooters
Are these bitches drunk? These bitches ain't lucid
Go against the queen your career will be elusive
Where your plaques? Where them stocks? Word to NASDAQ
Bitches ass-back, they was never in my tax-brack
(Yeah, oh no, no, no, no, yeah, oh no, no, no, no)
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull living like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinking
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle"

Want the cookie, so I gotta Chips Ahoy these niggas
But I never iPhone, Android these niggas
Use rubbers with 'em, I don't never raw these niggas
More money than em', I'ma son all these niggas
I ain't shopping, but it's like I gotta store these niggas
Put em' on time-out and never call these niggas
Pussy like girls, damn, is my pussy gay?
It's a holiday- Play with my pussy day!
Pussy this, pussy that, pussy cakin'
Pussy ride dick like she a Jamaican
Pussy stay warm, pussy on vacation
You loose bitches need a pussy renovation
You can eat it with a pussy reservation
Pussy 'bout to get a standing ovation
Clap, clap, clap for this pussy, nigga
But I can't give this pussy to a pussy nigga
Aw man, slow down
I'ma give you somethin' that you could hold down
But I can't give you head, I'm too ill for that

You the same clown nigga that was runnin' me down?
Now you all up in the store 'cause you wanna be down?
I said, rule #1 to be a boss ass bitch:
Never let a clown nigga try to play you
If he play you, then rule #2:
Fuck his best friends, then make 'em yes-men
And get a dick pic, and then you press send
And send a red heart and send a kissy face
And tell him that his friends love how your pussy tastes
And that's rule #3, I'm the school T
My wrists look like I am a jewel thief
But that's just 'cause I am a boss bitch
Now macaroni cheese and grill my swordfish

I be out in Cali watchin' back my Christmas vids
Every time I fuck him, yes I tell him this is his
Look down at it, and I said, ""This is big.""
And my game is so cold, I said, ""This is rigged.""
Best flow in the game, this is not a lie
Tell them bitches cross they t's and dot they I
I came back, bitches flows still boring
I said, ""Damn man, go back to whoring.""
You know I still lead the league in scoring
You know I'm still bad and I'm still foreign
I'ma give bitches time to get hot
Chill out at the game, New York, nigga buck
If they actually got bars, they could rock
But if not, I'ma destroy chicks a lot
But on the real, I'm album mode
Just dropped this freestyle 'fore these files get old
When I lay low, bitches be safe and sound
When I come back, they better not make a sound
I hear you!
When I'm back on the prowl
You bitches better have my money
'Cause I'm coming for you!
Uh, okay, I order rich bitch sauce
Rich bitch cold, got a rich bitch cough
Which bitch want it? I'll go rich bitch off
'Cause you know my style gettin' bit ripped off!

I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me
I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me
He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo
Cause its too much, and its too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us
But when you're away I can't get you out of my mind
But what if I met the one and your wasting your time

I push, p-p-push it, I p-p-push it like I'm in labor
And he'll t-t-teach me to, teach me love my neighbor
Just w-w-wait up, I'm processin' all the data
Processin' all the data, p-p-processin' all the haters
You was writin' disses, I was takin' pictures
Signin' autographs for all of my bad bitches
And in the nic of time it just dawned on
I am Nicki Minaj and it's all on me
But hey, maybe I'll never win
Maybe I'm settlin'
Can't let the devil in, I'm a comic book heroin
But when the wind blows, I'm so Marilyn
Write down, take a pictures, bitches e-mail that
I came to save a thing called female rap
But I hope my ninja powers
Don't fuck around and offend you cowards
You mad at me 'cus you think I got it easy
If we was in the second grade then you would tease me
Ya see, you still a lil snotty nose hood rat
I love Nicki scribbled all over you book bag
I love you too, I just wish your mother would've hugged you too
You know Nicki love the kids
Yellow brick road lookin' for the Wiz
But when it rains, it pours for real
Def Jam said I'm no Lauryn Hill
Can't rap and sing on the same CD
The public won't get it, they got A.D.D.
See Nicki, follow the rules
Go and say your prayers and get ready for school
(Yeah follow the rules, go and say my prayers and get ready for school)
Dear God, I am only what you made me
And I appreciate everything that you gave me
But like, I don't wanna do it no more
Sort of lost sight of what I'm doin' it for
Thought that I was doin' somethin' good for the game
Until they all started throwin' dirt on my name
Tell Debbie, I really, really tried
That I said I'm sorry, but I had to say goodbye
Tell Fendi, I'll never forget him
And please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted
(I'll never forget it, please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted)

This is celebration, this is levitation
Look at how you winning now, this took dedication
This is meditation, higher education
This the official competitor elimination
I was taking trips with Web to move weight,
Came back to queens then hit up a new state
Bitches don't know the half like they flunked at math
Bitches ain't have cut up crack up in the stash
50 cent Italian, icy flow
It's that run and get a dollar for a ice cream cone
'Cause they killed my little cousin Nicholas
But my memory's only happy images
This is for the hood, this is for the kids
This is for the single mothers, niggas doing biz
This one is for TT, Tweety, Viola, Sharika
Candice, Timby, Lauren, Iesha.
It's a celebration
Put it up for the ghetto
It's time like these
They know who we are by now
They know who we are.
Champion, a champion (champion, champion)
Yeah, okay, we made it to America
I remember when I used to stay with Erica
Label transferred 20 million to comerica
Fucking terrabus got me acting out of character
Young TO nigga, either riding' range
The Ferrari top down, screaming money ain't a thang
Tell me when I changed, girl, but only when I change
'Cause I live this shit for real, niggas know me in the game, they know
Makin' hits in 3 acre cribs
Cookin' up tryna eat nigga steak and ribs
I made a couple stars outta basic chicks
Nowadays blow the candles out, don't even make a wish
Having good times, making good money
Lot of bad bitches but they good to me
I make her do the splits for a rack
Wish you niggas good luck tryna get where I'm at
Straight like that

Mama taught me pride, yeah, she did it with the stamps
Wait a minute, everybody pause for the photo
Somebody tell these local hating niggas, I'm global
Tell me what I gotta do to get this champagne going
What I gotta do to get this coconut flowing
Don't let me in son, hundred bottles of the ace
Lemme in son, go money cases in my place let's celebrate

I sold my first 2 million dollars, I was 23.
I'm barely a man yet I had some killers under me
This ain't rated PG, this rated PJ.
'Cause that's where a nigga fuck, murder on replay
My 24th bday, I'm sailing to Bimini
You can see me on a yacht blasting Pac, little nah, I ain't greedy
I'm back to thugging bitches that can make it and kiss other bitches,
My man sister like me, I don't fuck my brother's sister
I just aspire your desire to be different
My 10 year old plan just one year til finish
My list went like this: first thing to sever,
The difference in pussy white black Latin or other
Here's a man who clearly isn't basic,
Waiting list just to hear me or witness the greatness
Loud laughter while writing my next chapter
Fast cash life, happily ever after

A bitch got more bars than where Big Meech is
No, you can't bone it, nigga, ain't no Lisa here
She gon' dread this and Nicki like Lisa hair
I buy, lil nigga, ain't no leaser here
The bitch gambled her career, now it's gon' be severe
I ain't just be watchin' bitches pitfalls
Stop doin' pills, but bitch don't withdrawals
I am in my mission rockin' pink drawers
I leveled up, bitch, I switch flows
MJ to the teens, I am Billie Jean and them bitches my sons

Lit like high beams, sippin' on my lean
Rippin' off my wings, knife out my spleen
Yeah, Carter time, I put bling on for the time
She changed her ringtone to one of mine, I changed 23s to 45s
Lil Tune like autotune, I get in her throat and she harmonize
She get the D and ooh la la la, and when she leave, I kumbaya
I whip it up with the left hand, I don't fuck with the yes man
I get younger by the second, I don't rust like Def Jam
It's a must I expand, and flex on my ex-team
Have sex on my jet ski, text my chef, told 'em ""Let's beef""
Changing girls, change is fine
She don't like girls, change her mind
Change the world, change my line
Never ever change my slimes
Changing looks, changing lies, changing skies, changing lanes

76,Cupids Got A Gun,Nicki Minaj,"
You watched me fall
Stood over me as I hit the ground
Then he whispered his name in my ear
Such a dark familiar sound
Cupid's got a gun
And he shot me with it
Cupid's got a gun
And he shot me with it
Now who said he's a lover
Really he's a murderer

imma put on my long pouffy skirt
Man I should have known he would do me dirt
So miserable i'ma storm through the puddle
Cupid's got a weapon gotta part with the devil
Tell him that i'm done tell him that i'm not here
Hit him with the lamp i'ma hit him with a chair
throw the 2-sign im dome wit sons
slo-mo as the pellets throw right from the gun

I I I I thought I could trust him
But I I I I didn't see it coming
Cos cupid's got a gun
And he shot me with it
Cupid's got a gun
And he shot me with it

Now who said he's a lover
Really he's a murderer
I should have known
By the way he took my breath away
And the way he held me
Often hurt me
He told me love was pain
I saw the winding road
Spinning out of control
Surrendered to his wrong direction
Now I don't know where to go
Cos cupid's got a gun
Cupid's got a gun
Now who said he's a lover
Really he's a murderer
Cupid's got a gun
And he shot me with it
Cupid's got a gun
And he shot me with it

81,Dear Old Nicki,Nicki Minaj,"Maybe you died 'cause everybody asked me, ""Where you at?""
I tried to channel you in hopes that I could stare back.
But it's like every intersection we just missed each other.
You got your fans waiting. Tell me you ain't 6 feet under.
And tell that you coming back and you just took a break.
Maybe I blamed you for everything - That was my mistake.
In hindsight, I loved your rawness and I loved your edge.
'Cause it was you who talked me down from jumping off the ledge.
Your earrings bamboo.
Your long nails, too.
Your BMW.
Every time you came through.
You was the brave heart.
You stole Wayne heart.
You never switched it up.
You played the same part.
But I needed to grow.
And I needed to know.
Were there some things inside of me that I needed to show?
So I just deaded you.
Left you in all black.
But dear, old Nicki
Please call back.
You told me you'd come when I needed you.
And you said it so sweetly I believed you
But I'm standing here calling.
I can't see you.
But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that.
Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamour?
Money, fame and power?
'Cause if so that will forever go down my lamest hour.
I should've kept you with me gettin' at them nameless cowards.
There was no match for you.
Couldn't defeat your prowess.
I had to make them changes - I hope you understood.
You see for every bad, I did a ton of good.
But you was underground and I was mainstream.
I live the life now, that we would daydream.
My only wish is you come enjoy it with me.
Get on them conference calls.
Go meet them lawyers with me.
The money came. Yeah.
Tripled and quadrupled it.
But I still miss us when we was just on some stupid shit.
And it still fucked the media.
They ridiculed you.
Never believed in ya.
They just deaded you.
Left you in all black.
But dear old Nicki.
Please call back.
You told me you'd come when I needed you.
And you said it so sweetly I believed you.
But I'm standing here calling.
I can't see you.
But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that.
And, yes. I'm holding you, holding you, holding you
And, yes. I'm holding you, holding you, holding you
And, yes. I'm holding you, holding you, holding you to that.
And, yes. I'm holding you, holding you, holding you
And, yes. I'm holding you, holding you, holding you
And, yes. I'm holding you, holding you, holding you to that."

Gotta lot of bags, but we never got baggage
Went to Wonderland on my hands, call me Alice, balance

Hopped off the boat, I am such a immigrant
Why he get Nicki Minaj tatted on his ligament
Wait, just for the record get wetter than fisherman
Pull up with some 26s up under the Michelin's
You know I pop-pop-pop it like a pistol
That's why I keep my wrist lookin' like a disco
And everywhere I go they tell me that I'm pretty
My money slow, my money stupid, money ditsy
Mami you bad, but Nicki is badder
Step your cookies up; go get you a ladder
We do it early like Cheerios and a bagel
I feel freer than the slaves on the railroad
You think I'm lying
I feel like I'm flying
I feel like I'm finally free
I'm free
Im free
Im free

I feel free
I'm rollin' with my niggas and we just bought the bar

Watch my feelings walk on by
Every guess, simple try

Guess who used to say yes boo

Skinny tight on that thing, we're the fresh blue
Super star, you know i'm in the press room
That's where im shitting on these bitches, restroom hahaha
That's ca ca ca ca, Get the fuck up out my face
Blow that rah rah rah rah
You been wack, Might send some Brooklyn niggas, get ya kidnapped
With ya bitch ass, Hit the dryer cause ya washed, splish splash

I never thought that I would have this feeling
But you think for once, but you could truly mean it
Wasting so much time at disagreeing
See i'm to the part where I don't know what, i'll believe it
Won't you make up your mind
Boy decide (decide, decide)
We can't go on like this, this ain't right

Why these bitches don't never be learnin'?
You bitches will never get what I be earnin'

That is a glacier, hits like a laser...
Drippin' on that work, trippin' off that perc

And so I pray you burn in hell and you never find the ocean...

I hope you lay down in your sleep and you choke on every lie you told
And when you're reaching out for me you'll see you reap everything you sowe
You piece of shit, you broke me down
Thought you said you, would hold me down
But I can see it in your eyes that your blinded by the flashing lights
And you's a stupid muthafucker for letting this thing pass you by
I hope your fire, fire burns baby

Trying to forgive you for abandoning me
Praying but I think I'm still an angel away
Angel away, yeah strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got their guns out aiming at me
But I become near when they aiming at me
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start coming and I start rising
Must be surprising, I'm just summising
I win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher
More fire

I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

Suffocating everytime it locks me in
Paintin' they own pictures then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that can ever be defined
I am not fly, I am levitation

105,Freedom,Nicki Minaj,"They never thank me for opening doors
But they ain't even thank Jesus when he died in the cross
Casue your spirit is ungrateful
Bitches is so hateful, I remain a staple
My career's been a pink prink
When I retire tell 'em think pink
Pink Friday is the imprint
And these bitches basic instinct
Oh shit, my commercials on
Did I really buy these bitches with commercials songs?
Did I really pop and sign everything, I do?
But before I continue let me thank my crew
So that was Young Wayne, Mac Maine, Baby and Slim Kane
Tex and Tia told me it wouldn't be in vain
Cause prior to me signing I coulda went insane
And even now I think, do I really want this fame?
Let me hit up and go
700 to go, overseas for a show
Everybody get quiet when I'm starting a show
Man, I birthin' these artists and I'm starting to show
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn her up, 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn her up, 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here
Who I wanna work with? Nobody
99% of them is nobody
Bitches acting like then killin shit, okay
When I check these bitches guns, no bodies
These niggas is fake fucks and opportunists
Niggas spend the last dime to say they copped the soonest
Why theses niggas going broke to get your approval?
Pretty soon they be back up on our Ramen noodles
B-B-B-Bible
Queen is the title
And if you on my rifle that means you suicidal
And if you in the club then it's a Young Money recital
I'm just that vital, I'm busy, never idle
I'm your idol, I'm your idol
I'm your motherfucking idol
Pink Friday at Macey's
Thongs and some pasties
Where the other female rapper perfume in here?
Cause I musta missed it
12 million to kick my feet up
Get ready, this the Re-Up
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn her up, 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn her up, 'cause it's crazy in here

Yeah, you get one turn, and one urn

Who ever gassed 'em ain't none of my concern
But, see, the Lord showed me dreams to confirm
They done went to witch doctors to bury the Barbie
But I double back, kill bitches, bury the body
And that go for anybody, you'll be thoroughly sorry
I could wage war or I come in peace like Gandhi
All my powers back now I'm scary to zombies
Bring the heat to her, sizzle 'em, ain't talking Kalonji
I done fasted and prayed, had to cleanse my body
Abstaining from sex, had to zen my body
I ain't givin', so don't ask, I don't lend my body

I never check my messages
Only thing you could ask me
Is how I want my sam-wiches
I want more cheese
Lots and lots of cheese
And when I'm on stage
I'm with SB's
And when you see my luggage
It say LVs
And when I'm on the plane
It's so empty
Hmm, that's why all those female rappers envy
Ha ha ha ha
Oh I'm sorry did she say something?
My Bad, Uh
You know maybe I was booked, I guess I missed ya
You Know, you know when u booked 4 times a week every week
It's kinda hard to keep track of bum bitches
Hahaha Oh You do the Math
It's barbie bitch!"
116,Girlfriend,Nicki Minaj,"""Grins""
Wish you could see me when I'm lying in bed
My eyes are blinded by your stars
My blood is blushing so red
(Oh my God)
I can see you in my head again
I don't suppose you should be dead again
In the car on 
I will scream and shout
'Cause I feel like I'm in heaven dancing with an angel
Cars burn out
Lost my breath now
'Cause I feel like I am falling through the clouds
Hope we're on the same wavelength
Hope you don't think that I'm crazy
Beaches and oceans for my baby
Hurry up and come and save me
I can't quite hear what you're saying
Because my body started shaking
Beaches and oceans, love is quaking
That's my heart that you were breaking"

119,Go Hard,Nicki Minaj,"Yo, SB, I think it's my time
You know why? My tears have dried
And I know that no weapon formed against me will prosper
And I truly believe that my haters are my motivators
Young Money
If you could you would get rid of me
Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'mma a go hard
If you was as real as me you would never
Let another girl sit in your throne
I done put the choke hold on now
They screamin', ""Nicki leave me alone""
I am, I'm still the one to beat
Ain't in a rush for mainstream
I am the streets, I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go, go, go, go hard
Gotta go, lemme get the car key
You don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie
Keep a marquis, everythin' sparkly
Hit 'em on a walkie-talkie
Hit 'em, hit 'em knock, knock
Tell 'em let me in, my name ring bells bitch buzz me in
And I only stop for pedestrians
Or real, real bad lesbian
Hit 'em wit the Mac, hit 'em wit the Tech 9
Hit 'em wit the Ruger by the intersect sign
Hit 'em wit a Tommy so my niggas call me Pammy
And I always keep a jimmy in the truck or in the Lamby
Put my whole burrough on my back and I'm gooda
I don't wanna hear what you would, what you coulda
I represent all the girls that stood up
Used to drink water wit a little bit of sugar
Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups
Doin' the scissor-leg on the mat wit my foot up
Young black pin-up, all of my bitches did up
Now I'm tellin' L.A. Reid to step his bid up
And I'm tellin' President Carter he picked a winner
Bitches like Nelly and Kelly got a dilemma
These birds all fly south in the winter
Fuck, I look like chompin' on a chicken dinner
You can hate me but why knock my hustle?
I'm a be a queen no matter how they shuffle
Skirts with the ruffle, Louis on the duffle
I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle, no muzzle
Bitches is softer than al dente
Cut from a different kentae, tell 'em I'm the ninja
Weezy is my sensei, so I call him Splinter, faster than a sprinter
Gimme my chopsticks, I'll have the rap bitches for dinner
This is for my gentlemen in button-ups and khakis
This is for my nigga 7-up in Castaki
This is for my niggas wheelying them Kawasaki's
Shout out to the vakiees, salt fish ackees
Kisses is to my fans unless I'm feeling kinda cocky
Winter Wonderland is on my hand, it's kinda rocky
I am Nicki Minaj or Lewinski
Pumps on the clutch, right hand on the six-speed
Write my own raps I gotta go, I gotta get me
If you could you would get rid of me
Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard
But I won't let you get to me

I gotta go, go, go, go hard
From slap and cry you start to die, so I must go harder
Gotta make these bitches know me just like Bobby know water
Better yet like Bubba, know shrimp but he don't say shit
When the gun on his lip and I don't say shit put the gun
On my hip, so I don't say shit but the gun on my hip
If you don't wanna drown don't come on my ship
Check how them bitches just run on my dick
And me, I'm nasty as a son of a bitch
I still got that bitch cum on my lips
If you ain't got money don't come on my strip
And if you got money don't come on my strip
I wear that metal, no Olympic
But I can still make you tumble and flip
You fuckin' wit me if you fuckin wit Nick
They ain't fuckin' wit me, they ain't fuckin' wit Nick
Your girlfriend her decision is split
'Cause she wanna fuck me and she wanna fuck Nick
They wonder if he be fuckin Nick
As long as she be fuckin' rich
That's why I keep my luggage
'Cause I swear y'all a fuckin' trip
Young Money Dungeon, bitch, my swagger just punching bitch

Came straight from the hood with the cross appeal

131,Here I Am,Nicki Minaj,"Why is that you could only see the worst in me?
I swear sometimes I feel like it nurtures me
But to keep it all real is kinda hurting me
I could say I'm done with it, but it lurks in me
So I'm a just tell myself that it works for me
Take a real long drive in the Mercedes
And I might pop a couple of them percaces
Yeah, that'll make me transform to Hercules
I am, here I am
Here I am, here I am, so take me, 'cause I am
Here I am, here I am, so take me, 'cause I am
Here I am, here I am, so take me, 'cause I am
I am, here I am
I swear to God, man, everything in life is old
And the only thing that change is the price of gold
Even in the afterlife I'm a fight your soul
'Cause the second time around I'll be twice as grown
So do you take me to be who I am?
To have and to hold till death do us part
'Cause if not it's just best we both part
'Cause how am I supposed to finish what you start?
You got me thinking twice to just breathe
Then you say I won't survive if I leave
But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve
I no longer need your attention, at ease
It's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar
It's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar
Now it's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar
It's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score?

Look him in the eye and a nigga might blink,
Aim at his brain and a nigga might think.

133,High School,Nicki Minaj,"He said he came from Jamaica
He owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was getting money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things
Ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to sing sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
5-year bid up, North on they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him
Put him on lock, seatbelt them
Took him out to Belgium, welcome!
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order
I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk
But I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa
I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy
Then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone
They holler at me but its you
You, this ain't high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want
Whip it whenever you want
Baby, it's yours anywhere, everywhere
Baby it's your world, ain't it?
Baby it's your world, ain't it?
She got a nigga at home and one on the side
Best friend is a dike, they fucked around a few times
Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight
I tell her make me some money, she tell me make her a wife
I tell her: ""bitch, you crazy, fück wrong with you?
And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hitting
And I say: ""what about them niggas?""
She say: ""what about them niggas?""
You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on something tight
Don't judge me, I get life
She love me like a brother
But fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it
The genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet, I'm a need goggles
She tell me that's it's mine
I tell her stop lying, mine and who else?
She say worry about yourself, Lil Tune
They holler at me but its you
You, this ain't high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want
Whip it whenever you want
Baby, it's yours anywhere, everywhere
Baby it's your world, ain't it?
Baby it's your world, ain't it?
I know you want it boy
I see you trying
Just keep on pushing
I'ma let you slide in
Just close your eyes and
This horizon
It's ready, come get you some

You said you thought you was ready and I said let's see
But I ain't mean that, I need some fucking proof
Cause what happens if I fall in love then you cut me loose
You just a heart breaker won't let you break mine
Cause I'll be smashing windows and cutting them break lines

Cause who knew if I should let myself go with you
Who knows, who knows, so I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
Even though I said fuck you, I lied, I lied
I thought eventually you would let me go
That was my insecurities and my ego
Missed my jump shot missed my free throw
Miss the way we kiss miss the d o
Man it was good while it lasted
That shit wasn't real it was magic
If it was a record it would have been classic
But fuck you though, orgasmic
This is what I gotta do to keep me from falling
Stalling the truth, who knew what you'd
Do If I let you in
My mama ain't raised no fool
I am not your usual typical type
Who would protect me if I never hide?
Falling so fast I am afraid of you
So I lied, I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

Headlights beam bright got the best boobs

We hit a couple malls then I remind her
Cuz on the road of life she is the spokesmodel
Her body tighter than a coke bottle
She super charge cars anything for Minaj
And she could only park in the superstar garage
'Cause she-she-she-she bad if anybody ask
Her bags is boss cuz her leather so soft
If it ain't of been softer tell 'em raise the offer
Used to fuck with a yellow bitch named Porsche
N-n-now it's me and her she say it's you Minaj
Red underneath her shoe, that's Louie Vuitton

I want to smash your fears, and get drunken off your tears
Don't share your smile with anyone else but me
I want to touch your heart, I want to crush it in my hands
Make you plead and cry as you give up all the lies
We're not lovers, but more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more crying, to get me through
I keep dancing 'til the morning with somebody new
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you, over you, over you
Stuck in a real bad dream, oh man it feels so new to me
Should be in your arms but I'm begging at your feet
It's been a real hard night and I just hold my pillow tight
He won't love me back, no, it's not you and I
We're not lovers, but more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more crying, to get me through
I keep dancing 'til the morning with somebody new
Tonight I'm getting over you

Meditate and do my yo-ger
Then I pull up to the club in a Rover
A Celine bag on my shoulder

because the top is lonely
what the fuck they gon' say

I'm the best bitch doin' it, doin' it
I'm the best bitch doin' it, doin' it
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best!
I remember when i couldn't buy my mother a couch
now i'm sittin' at the closin' bought my mother a house
you could never understand why i grind like i do
Mikiyah and Gulani while i grind like i do
C-c-c-cause even when my daddy was on crack, i was cracked
now the whole album crack you ain't gotta skip a track
i ain't gotta get a plaque, I ain't gotta get awards
i just walk up out the door all the girls will applaud
All the girls will come in, as long as they understand
that i'm fighting for the girls, that never thought they could win
cause before they could begin you told'em it was the end
but I am here to reverse the curse that they live in
got two bones to pick
I 'ma only choose one
you might get addressed on the second album
which means you can breath
tell that motherfucker say so
to all my bad bitches
I can see your halo
I hear they comin' for me
because the top is lonely
what the fuck they gon' say
what the fuck they gon' say
I'm the best bitch doin' it, doin' it
I'm the best bitch doin' it, doin' it
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best!
Ah, it's ok
it's ok
long as you know
long as you know
long as you motherfuckers know
I'm the best, best, best, best
I hear they comin' for me
because the top is lonely
what the fuck they gon' say
what the fuck they gon' say
I'm the best bitch doin' it, doin' it
I'm the best bitch doin' it, doin' it
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best!"

Paso los días, obsesionado
Pensar que tú ni me conoces
Mirando tu perfil toda la noche,
¿dónde voy a parar?
Si sales conmigo, una aventura te daré,
Te enamoraré y el mundo pondré a tus pies.
No sé si le gusto, ayúdenme a enamorarla
Díganle que ya le he escrito mil canciones
Que me regale una cita
(Alkilados)
No sé si le gusto, ayúdenme a enamorarla

Y yo no sé por qué será,
Que me tienes tan envuelto,
Solo pienso en tu cara y tu cuerpo
triste es mi realidad,
Pero sé que con un beso,
Soy capaz de cambiar tu universo.
(Alkilados)
Es que me gustas tú,
Desde el primer día en que yo te vi
Baby me gustas tú.
Tienes que ser, tienes que ser para mí
Es que me gustas tú,

Baby me gustas tú
Tienes que ser, tienes que ser para mí

Señorita, regálame una cita
Yo soy el hombre que usted necesita,
Que la enamore y le alegre la vida
Yo estaré esperando hasta que se decida
Deme la oportunidad, de a su corazón entrar
Baby yo te prometeré, una vida llena de amor
(Pura pura pura pura playa)
Una vida llena de amor

All new everything, plus pay the rent for me
If we in the wilderness, niggas pitch the tent for me
Tent for me, tent for me, get me bodied
Long hair, no makeup, doing pilates
Those niggas don't step on my damn Zanottis
All them bitches my sons but who's the Daddy?
I graduate with honors, I ball, 'Nead O'Connor
I did a freestyle, then I got a shout out from Obama
Yes, yes, I am ill I go in for the kill
Hoes is my sons, birth control, I am on the pill

He said he want a good box like Pacquiao
I said, ""Well, my name Nicki and it's nice to meet you.""
If you really wanna know, I'll give you my procedure
Got a whole bunch of pretty gang in my clique
And we lookin' for some ballers, alopecia
I hate wack niggas, I should really slap niggas
These niggas trippin' when I put 'em on the map niggas
How you gon' break fly? How you gon' fake die?
Ain't at no wedding but all my girls cake, ha!
Sleeping on me, no mattress though
I'm a burn the beat down, no matches though
No they can't keep up? They molasses slow
I'm the greatest Queens bitch, with the cashes flow
Looking at me like it's my fault
Trying to take sneak pictures with they iPhone
I like independent bitches like July 4th
Now that's what young Harriet died for

Yellin' ""Rasta, alright! "" when I'm ridin' by,
See I used to be the wife of a king,
Back when I was smugglin' them things in the bing.
Now that I'm a boss bxtch,
It's a win-win,
Come to Mr. Chow's or meet me in Chin-Chin,
Now I get'cha ching & my name bells ring -
Oops, I mean my name ring bells, ding ding.

I'm in Jamaica with them keys under palm trees,
The leprechaun sees what my palm reads.
And if my heart seize, please call my aunties,
I think them girls tellin', I hear them boys yellin' 
Get down, get down, get down down,
Get d- get down, get down, get down down,
Get down, get down, get down down,
Get down, get down on the ground,
Get down, get down on the ground.
Man, fxck a P0,
And fxck a C0,

Mad they done tapped my trio,
Begged my skio,
Heard the bxtch lyin' like Leo.
Anyway, I'm the ninja,
Kawasaki blazin',
In a kimono, ""Konichiwa"" to the Asians.
I kick, kick, kick it like I'm Bruce Lee's son,
So all of that yellin' in the street soon done.
Cus if I take my ski mask off, then I'm dumbin',
The young Chaka Khan, yes - I am every woman.
And I am 'bout that coke, not what'cha put the rum in,
Say a little prayer, tell the Lord that I'm comin' (comin')

I'm in Jamaica with them keys under palm trees,
The leprachaun sees what my palm reads.
And if my heart seize, please call my auntie,
I think them girls tellin', I hear them boys yellin' 
Can you hear the yellin'?
Comin' for me, comin' for me-e-e-e.
Comin' for me, comin' for me, comin' for me."

It means that I never let you go, girl!

Cause they can't stop what we got,
They can't shot what we shot, or cut what we cut,
They say don't trust, he a rapper!
... the next time you hear that bullshit, just slap him!
Tell him you're crazy, you know my baby
... bonny and clyde like bee and jay-z!
Before the rapping, before all the...
Before the light camera action, he was back then,
So with louis talking to you, not hoodstar
You love me for me and not for my new car,

Without you, that's my body acapela.

I must confess, I love you like dudes love breast
They're just mad cause when I choose, I choose the best
I never settle for less
I must say, you got impeccable taste
Flossy, bossy, gotta a hell of a face
And you? you takes the cake

You know I can't control my temper get buck for you,
Fucks with who? Nigga I fucks with you!

And damn, just think, you picked Nic for you
Out of everybody in the world, I'm your girl

161,Last Chance,Nicki Minaj,"Yo, I could've been had fame
Jump shot with a stupid ass aim
'Cause you couldn't get around the last name
So my crossover wins the last game
And it's ill, right?
Switched up the flow, but it's still right
Go back to that, yeah, I still might
I'ma just do me when it feel right
You can bring it any day
Natural bad ass, NBA
That's my initials, that's why officials
Don't blow the whistle, bang, bang the pistol
And I'm bossy
Can't keep these ho's up off me
Damn the flow nasty, coffee
Don't you do like the Pope and cross me
Yeah, this is my last chance, last chance
Yeah, this is my last chance, then shoot
I'm ready to shoot
I'm ready to shoot
Ready to shoot
I'm ready to shoot
Ready to shoot, ready to shoot
I'm ready, I'm ready to shoot
Ready to shoot
I'm ready, I'm ready to shoot
I'm ready to shoot
I get it in though
No sexual innuendo
Nobody that I can just depend on
Until I touch down in the end zone
And then they come out like roaches
P-p-pecking away like vultures
But little did they know, distribute the payroll
Pick up the outfit, pick out the single
Sadly, I'm so business savvy
Similar protocol but the tidbits vary
Never been like me and never been like this
My flows are crisis, they scream in high pitch
Gun cock, pause
And I'm well aware of the gun laws
Tell 'em that I'm running for the top, Forbes

I get it in though
No sexual innuendo
Nobody that I can just depend on
Until I touch down in the end zone
And then they come out like roaches
P-p-pecking away like vultures
But little did they know, distribute the payroll
Pick up the outfit, pick out the single
Sadly, I'm so business savvy
Similar protocol but the tidbits vary
Never been like me and never been like this
My flows are crisis, they scream in high pitch
Gun cock, pause
And I'm well aware of the gun laws
Tell 'em that I'm running for the top, Forbes

163,Letcha Go,Nicki Minaj,"
Babe boy you must got nicki twisted
I would've left before but you insisted
Said that I was your all and I believed you
That's why it hurts to the core I gotta leave you
How could you love me and humiliate me
You ain't my man don't affiliate me
With all your plans cause you really made me
A lil bitch when that really ain't me
Mondays was the fun days
From the slum to the runway
Runs in the hyundai
Niggas didn't have your money it was gun play
Used to tell me to listen to what a thug say
At night I would sleep on you
And I guess I did sleep on you
Cause when they said it I said creep on who
No not my boo
Ain't what he gon do

Oh now you wanna be with me
But you can't be with me
Boy leave me alone
You know you did me wrong
So I gotta letcha go
If you wanted me in your life
You shoulda treated me right
Boy leave me alone
You know you did me wrong
So I gotta letcha go

Why you saying you ain't feel her
You was in the villa
She was in the white chinchilla
You was sippin on a miller
My bitch pam had the hidden cam like killa
Funny how ya win some
Ya lose some
Never worry where your income would come from
Cause no matter where you was I held you down
Up north to uptown
So how you sound
Now you all up in my face bout you make mistakes
If I'da known you was fake I'da laced your steak
Strick nine one time in your welchs grape
Quit lying
Why you lying
I watched the tape
Now get up out my dressing room
Give me some f'ing room
Go get your mind right and take it as a lesson learned
Just like usher nigga you gon have to let it burn
To the left and I ain't talkin about jigga girl

Oh now you wanna be with me
But you can't be with me
Boy leave me alone
You know you did me wrong
So I gotta letcha go
If you wanted me in your life
You shoulda treated me right
Boy leave me alone
You know you did me wrong
So I gotta letcha go"
164,Letter To Lil Wayne,Nicki Minaj,"Dear Wayne
If this shit ever gets to you
Listen to me, There's some things
I should have said to you
First of all
Every rapper need to bow to you
As a fan man I really am proud of you
Second of all I gotta say thanks
You really did alot
For my out of state banks
With that being said
Lets get down to the real
I still don't understand
What went down with the deal
And I been waiting on you
Just to give me the word
You know, A couple nouns
And a couple of verbs
I do it for them girls
That be flippin' the bird
Tryna get up out the hood
And get into the 'burbs
But everything you said
Was it just pretend?
Maybe it was all a game like ESPN
I don't really care if they hate on you
I be turning down meetings
Just to wait on you
But what I don't understand is
Why you told them you signed me
If you wasn't ready
To get totally behind me
I mean honestly, How could you deny me?
You know you're Harry
And I'll always be Hermione
I've been lonely
I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending that's all I can do
The love I'm sending
Ain't making it through to your heart
Dear Wayne
I'm writing another letter cause
You never did respond
It's been a couple months
See when I speak
I say what people wanna hear
So this will be the last thing
That they gonna hear
But this will be the realest shit
That I ever wrote
You see me falling
Why you never sent down a rope?
I woulda climbed up
But now my times up
I swear to God man
I thought you had it lined up
But if the Lord
Had a head of thorns
Who am I but a broad
With some metaphors
Knockin' on a set of doors
Knockin' on heavens doors
Let's play a game, Just for pretend
Could we play a game?
Lets act like you coming to me
Like you laced up your shoes
Started running to me
And you was running out of breath
But you kept going
'Cause you finally realized what you slept on
You could take your own life
And you're a sinner, I made you dinner
But you better be a hell of a sprinter
If you're reading this letter
I pulled the trigger
I done pulled the trigger
If you're reading this letter
I pulled the trigger
I've been lonely
I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending that's all I can do
The love I'm sending
Ain't making it through to your heart"

Yeah, I roll with niglets we so explicit you won't resist it
It's been a long time comin but you don't know specifics
No more phony wishes, we ready cause now we know the business
Come holla at ya god, I always make it pour
Invite me to your wedding, I'll throw dollars at the bride
It's Dirty Money, dirty jeans, and dirty skullies
You heard he funny, but chill, I'm still absurdly gully
Most these rappers lost, there's no cash at all
If I knew this back then, I would of just played basketball
Well maybe not, they said that I never passed the ball
If there's no cash involved, baby I'm a laugh it off

It's been a long time comin but I came
Now everybody in the rap game know my name
But honey ain't a damn thing funny when your fame
Outweighs your change (outweights your change)
It's been a long time comin but I came
Now everybody in the rap game know my name
But honey ain't a damn thing funny when your fame
Outweighs your change (outweights your change)
It's been a long time comin but I came

She invites me to the condo
Uh-oh, wifey's in Chicago (oh, oh)
My side piece, but she's also someone's wife
So time we spend is borrowed
But it's our moment
Right here, fuck tomorrow
'Cause moments like these are to die for
And she's clear all
Nice and easy as hair when I'm bleaching it blonde
So we got that lightning in a bottle
She's tipsy, I'm sober
So she gets a chip on her shoulder
Sits on the sofa, I go to load a
Slick Rick song or throw some Souls of Mischief on
She goes, ""All that old school hip-hop is so fucked
Think that shit's got pneumonia""
I told her, ""Bitch now, just hold up""
That's why rap needs a doctor
A genre slip, known to swole up
It's time to check it for strep or some tonsillitis
'Cause like what they swab you with when your throat hurts
That's why Tribe is so vital, we need Q-Tip for the culture
Speed it up a little bit
You ain't dealin' with a fuckin' featherweight
I used to medicate until I'd get a fuckin' bellyache
And now I'm finna step on the pedal, don't wanna ever brake
I wanna accelerate to a level that I can elevate
The men up with the pen, I'll make it mothafuckin' detonate
I wanna make it acapella, wait, I gotta set a date
With the devil and celebrate, together we can renovate
And re-develop hella weights, and I'ma get a special place... now...
Take a ride with me, hop into my time machine
I'ma take the driver's seat as I thrust into hyperspeed
Like I'm a meteorite and mothafuck love, fuck a knee to your right
And be behind, I'm a human encyclopedia
I must be like pie crust because I was bred to rise like I was yeast
And you're never gonna reach these
heights, they're just too high to reach it
I ain't even reached my fuckin' highest
You better pick another game, try hide-and-seek
And you might wanna decide to cheat
'Cause you gotta open your eyes to peep
Am I indeed the last of a dying breed?
Even if you're fire-breathing, shit you can say to inspire heat
If you wrapped your entire meat pad up in a dryer sheet
And I'm back to rule the kingdom of fuck it
Better not use me as your topic, anybody who brings me up, duck it
Let me keep it one hundred,
two things shouldn't be your themes of discussion
The queen and her husband,
last thing you're gonna wanna be is our subjects, yeah
Whatever you say, Mrs. Majesty (oh, oh)
Whatever you want, you can have from me (oh, oh)
I want your love, just lead me on

What's been done-done need no more say that's that
Hey, never find me in the club laid back
I wanna jump to this jam until we see the sun
So, so hot in here it feels like a jungle, yeah
Me don't like boys that enjumble
One-time bust a shot for my champion girls
Tell 'em guys super-size me a combo
N-n-no one got the ammo, that's why I bullet-proofed the Lambo
In the middle-east on a camel
Runnin' through the jungle, Rambo, Liberace tango
Swingin' on a vine, mango
So call me Simba, little mama, 'cause Mufasa couldn't stop a bitch
I fly in on that chopper just to buy Balenciaga
It's just me, Mr. Miyagi, and the Phantom of the Opera
Goin' blocka motherfucker, got that big rocket launcher
Massive attack, massive attack
Got them bomb-bombs make the whole club go back
Hey, bet the DJ gon' bring this one back
Hey, like the swagger mom bring on this track, hey
Massive attack, massive attack
What's been done-done need no more say that's that
Hey, never find me in the club laid back
I wanna jump to this jam until we see the sun
Detonating a bomb, detonating a fire
Rosé by the bucket, money-makin' attire
Detonating a bomb, detonating them hits
Fixin' to buy up the bar, all my bitches is rich
You better duck when it comes, better duck 'cause it's comin'
Best believe me we're on, got them runnin', r-runnin'
Now tell them rap bitches that Nicki said this
We got tom-toms over here bigger than a monster
We got tom-toms over here bigger than a monster
Block, block, block, block, block, block, block, block
We got tom-toms over here bigger than a monster

She rides that dick and she handles her liquor
She knock a bitch out aaaand fight
Coming out swinging like Tiger Woods wife
Yeah she could get a little hasty
Chicks better cover up there chests like pasty's
Couple girl friends and they all a little crazy
Coming down the street like a parade Macy's
I fill her up balloons
Test her and guns get drawn like cartoons
Doh, but I aint talkin bout homer
Chick so bad the whole crew wanna bone her


Yo, now all these bitches wanna try and be my besty
But I take a left and leave them hanging like a testi
Trash talk to em then I put em in a hefty
Running down a court I'm thuggin on them Lisa Lefty
It's going down, basement, friday 13th guess who's playing Jason
Tuck yourself in you better hold on to your teddy
It's nightmare on Elm street and guess who's playing Freddy

Chef cooking for me, they say my shoe game crazy

I live next door to Brad Pitt's home
I like bad bitches, cause they like bad bitches too
I like hood niggas with a bad attitude
They could never reach Young Nic's magnitude
Even if they had a longitude latitude
Listen up ho this is my territory
You are my son, like an episode of Maury, like an episode of ER
Bitch I'm hotter than the D.R
When it comes to rap skill, ain't nobody wanna see her
Motherfuckers flexin, motherfuckers acting
Bitches is my sons and they causin' contractions
Ain't pushing out I'm a give them to the clinic
Cah wait, we nuh rate dem gyal and dem gimmick
Wack sauce I can hear it in your tone

I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
Aye yo, throw your wrist-es up, all my bitches up
These niggas is pussier than what? All them dicks is up
All my real niggas down to ride, throw your GSXRs up
I ain't in the projects, but all my bricks is up, rrrr
You can't be Pablo if your work ain't sellin'
What the fuck is this bitch inhalin'?
I would've helped you out that pit you fell in
I am the generous Queen! Ask Ms. Ellen
Tried to drop ""Another One"", you was itchin' to scrap
You exposed your ghostwriter, now you wish it was scrapped
Heard your pussy on ""Yuck,"" I guess you needed a Pap
What type of bum bitch shoot a friend over a rack?
What type of mother leave her one son over a stack?
Lil Boogie down basic bitch thinkin' she back
Back to back, oh you mean, back to wack?
""Back to Back""? Me and Drizzy laughed at that
They say numbers don't matter but when they discussin' the kings
They turn around and say Lebron ain't got 6 rings
I never signed a 360, bitch you wild dumb
That's why Jay ain't clear his verse for your album
Sheneneh, you a fraud committin' perjury
I got before and after pictures of your surgery
Rah took you to her doc, but you don't look like Rah

Why do niggas that are not involved love to get involved?
Why do niggas claim the streets and act just like the law?
Riddles that I cannot seem to solve, man
Cristal, come at me, Weezy F and Nick
All come and spoke about your shit in '15
Man, I know you niggas saw this one comin'
My net worth sound like *brrrrrr*
But they don't pay in cash
Niggas see me like, ""What up, Killa?""
Man, please stop bringin' up my past
I'd really love to leave that behind
Sometimes I ask God, ""Man, why him?""
Like the team that I would never leave behind
I really gotta ease off the wine
Which is funny because I just saw Nick the other day
And she keeps getting finer over time

Blunt be tight as biker shorts, twisted like some handlebars
Lil' Tune out a cartoon or Avatar
I just looked in the mirror like, ""All right, all right, all right""
I would let that little leaguer right there fuck my wife, word
I don't need no fraud bitches in and out my life, word
Eatin' out my pockets, they be in and out of sight, word

Yeah, that was a setup for a punchline on duct tape
Worried 'bout if my butt fake
Worry 'bout ya'll niggas, us straight
These girls are my sons, Jon and Kate plus eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of an update
Hut-hut one, hut- hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fuck with them real niggas who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is
These hoes couldn't test me even if they name was pop quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck wit', mad bitches we don't fuck wit'
I don't fuck wit' them chickens unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in like seasoning
And tell them bitches, blow me, Lance Stephenson
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only
I never fucked Nicki cause she got a man
But when that's over then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought God damn, this is the perfect time
We had just come from that video
You know LA traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low key or maybe high key
I been peeped that you like me, you know
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW, yea
Type to wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Claire Huxtable
Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you
Oh, that's cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever try to fuck
Just give me the heads up so I can plan for it
I never fucked Nicki and that's fucked up
If I did fuck she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
Cause she act like she need dick in her life
But that's another story, I'm no story teller
I piss greatness like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend would beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mother's instead
You got the hiccups, you swallow the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, street beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' bout running in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes wit me, messed up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang take the B off behavior, my nigga
For reals if you mouth off I blow your face off
I mean pop-pop-pop then I take off, nigga
Now you see me, nigga, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
16 in the clip, one in the chamber
17 ward bully with 17 bullets
My story is how I went from poor me
To please pour me a drink and celebrate with me"

Yo, people will love you and support you when it's beneficial
I'mma forgive, I won't forget, but I'mma dead the issue
Soon as you out a nigga's life is when they start to miss you
They see you doin' good now it's kinda hard to diss you
Niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you
Niggas be mad when they can't come and live lavish with you
But I sped off in a Benzi
I see the envy when I'm causing a frenzy
So I pop pills for 'em
Cop cribs in the hills on 'em
Pills n potions
We're overdosing
I'm angry but I still love you
Pills n potions
We're overdosing
Can't stand it but I still love you
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove

220,Right Thru Me,Nicki Minaj,"You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo
You let me win, you let me ride
You let me rock, you let me slide
And when they looking you let me hide
Defend my honour, protect my pride
The good advice I always hated
But looking back it made me greater
You always told me forget the haters
Just get my money, just get my weight up
Know when I'm lying, know when I'm crying
It's like you got it down to a science
Why am I trying, no you ain't lying
I tried to fight it, back with defiance
You make me laugh, you make hoarse from yelling at you
At gettin' at you, pickin' up dishes and throwing them at you
Why are you speaking when no-one asks you
You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo

How do you do that shit?
How do you, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo
What are we doing?
Could you see through me?
Cause you say Nicki and I say ""Who me?""
You say ""No you"" and I say ""Screw you""
Then you start dressing, and you start leaving
And I start crying and I start screaming
The heavy breathing but what's the reason
Always get the reaction you wanted
I'm actually frontin', I'm asking you something
Yo, answer this question, class is in session
Tired of letting passive agression
Control my mind, capture my soul
Ok you're right, just let it go
Okay you got it, its in the can
Before I played it, you knew my hand
You can turn a free throw to a goal
Nigga got the peep hole to my soul
You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo
You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo
Stop, oooh stop, oooh
Won't you just stop looking through me
Cause I can't take it
No I can't take it
You see right through me
How do you do that shit?

Or you can even call me Wanda cause I'm ""ret ta go"".
You know I'm spoiled lil daddy, stomps the floor.
We can do it on Fifth Ave in the Department store.

All my Harajuku girls say I am they icon.

When a good girl's gone, she gone forever
And you can't make it rain without the stormy weather
And its funny when it rains, when it rains it pours
It would've never happened if I would've stayed in doors
Would've never happened if I never traded in my textbooks
Cause now I'm hot but the critics say I'm just looks
They say I'm too sexy, they say I'm selling out
Cause when I come out niggas get their umbrellas out
I take the L cause I don't won't to see my brother loose
Been through it all but I can never fill my mothers shoes
And I don't want a hand out
I just want my adlibs to get panned out
And I just wanna tell the girl that could feel me
That I just play the card the nigga dealt me
See everything I been through could've killed me
That's why there really nothing you could tell me
You see I live for the bill, I die for the bill
I still make sure I read the bi to the bile
And everytime I write I'm precise in my skill
Its more out of life then just ice in your grill
Fuck me, blame me
Fuck You Pay Me
This is what you made me, where my money at
Say you want to drape me, turned around and rape me
Now you won't mistake me, where my money at
Where my girls at, where my girls at
If they be fronting then tell them ""yo where my money at""
Where my-where my money at

You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade, in your face, and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just planning a wedding, caught cagin' doves
You was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs
Are you alone? Do you need someone?
Is it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?
Thousand words don't change a thing
Is it only three? Three words that you're missing?
Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think I know
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o
We're 'bout to play here
We're 'bout to play here
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o
We're 'bout to play

I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here

Welcome to the crying game where you lose your soul
Where it ain't no easy cash, you got to use the toll
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?
Another slap to the face, another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature, not cause I hate ya
Not cause I wanna, guess I wanna imitate ya
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin'?
I couldn't breathe and you ain't even know it
How come you never show it?
All this love you speak of
All I want is to love and to be loved
(To love and to be loved)
I'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win
And I'm coming undone
Cause the tears don't end
Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy

Myx Moscato and vodka, I'ma mix it
Roll that spaceship, we about to get lifted
Lift and the President gift is for the gifted
This what you came, this what you came for
You get what you buy, this what you paid for
So make sure the stars is what you aim for
Make mistakes though
I never worry, life is a journey
I just wanna enjoy the ride
What is the hurry? It's pretty early
It's ok, we'll take our time
The night is still young
The night is still young
The night is still young
And so are we
The night is still young
The night is still young

And so are we
Ayo, drinks on you or the drinks is on me
We ain't going nowhere like tanks on E
We still getting money, which bank is it gonna be?
If he sexy, he planking on me
So when them big boys want all of that
Tell the bartender, say my order back
It's bottle service, he ordered that
Might let him take it home and slaughter that
He got friends for all of my friends
They ain't leaving 'till we say when
And we gon' hangover the next day
But we will remember this day
So drop the pop and get low
Or we can drop the top and just cruise
We fresh to death, down to the shoes
My only motto in life is don't lose
I never worry, life is a journey
I just wanna enjoy the ride
What is the hurry? It's pretty early
It's ok, we'll take our time
The night is still young
The night is still young
The night is still young
And so are we
The night is still young
The night is still young

261,Top Of The World,Nicki Minaj,"
I remember standing in the mirror
Searching for a winner but I didn't see it in her
Now I've gone from a zero to a super-hero-oh-oh
woah, woah
Chasing dreams got me all over the World
Now I'm sitting on top of the World
We winning, we winning
Cause we sitting on top of the World

This is for the little girls that say Nicki you pretty
When you come to the city you dont act high for Diddy?
You be up on the block, posted up in the drop
And everybody get up in whether you like it or not
But how them girls blow up but don't come to the hood
How they turn they nose up like they don't come from the hood
Most of them be in sight til it's time to pitch
Thats when everything they write be a contradiction
I tell em I do it for the love
I do it for the hugs
I do it for the buzz
I do it for the thugs
I do it for the rich
I do it for the poor
I do it for the kids that can't do no more

I remember standing in the mirror
Searching for a winner but I didn't see it in her
Now I've gone from a zero to a super-hero-oh-oh
woah, woah
Chasing dreams got me all over the World
Now I'm sitting on top of the World
We winning, we winning
Cause we sitting on top of the World

This is for my little homies that be asking for kisses
When I'm granting they wishes they be passing they digits
They be up on the block, getting screwed by the cops
Cuttin' school gettin knocked whether they like it or not
They'll break in your door, might break in your jaw
They'll bring back a lye if you bring them an O
But what you really ain't know they airborne for stardom
With the ball in the gardens, stand tall, no dodgin'
No matter the squadron, lieutenant or sargeant
Air Force, the army, air force and army fatigues is on em
No heats is on 'em
Cause grandmamma prayed that he'd leave the corner.


I remember when I lost everything in a fire
Now I got fire, 23?s almost higher
Shout outs to my brothers Jelani and Makiah
Thanks to the Messiah, my money getting higher
One time for my niggas that be huggin' the block
2 Times for my niggas that be ducking the cops
3 Times for my girls that pushing they own rides
Lyrics courtesy of www.killerhiphop.com
Stooshing they own rides from bitches they dont like
Sometimes you get mad, wanna blaze the gun
I see you without a man, might erase ya son
Well look, when you blow up, everybody go shudder
This goes out to everybody on the come up

(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cause we sitting on top of the world
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cause we sitting on top of the world
We winning, winning
Narcotics on the track."

You know, uhn, uhn, uhn)
Uh, thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm 'bout is talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and their mood change
Like a motherfucker
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you are undercover
I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other (oh)
Talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it
(You know, uhn, uhn, uhn
You know, uhn, uhn, uhn)
Yo, thinkin' out loud
I must have about a milli on me right now
And I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record
I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record
Man, this a 65 million single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair, right now? Uhh
Do you hear me?
I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch, if you dare me
I ain't never need a man, to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this
I floss everyday, but I ain't a dentist
Your whole style and approach, I invented
And I ain't takin' that back, cause I meant it
(You know, uhn, uhn, uhn
You know, uhn, uhn, uhn)
Uh, thinkin' out loud
I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile
LOL to the bank checkin' my account
Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account
Pretty ladies, are you here? Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low
You ain't gotta tell your friend that I eat it in the morning
Cause she gonna say ""I know""
Can I hit it in the bathroom? Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub
Girl, this my new dance move
I just don't know what to call it
But bitch you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
What's his name? Not important
I bought some cocaine, you can snort it
She became a vacuum, put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off like chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless and flawless
Smallest regardless, largest in charge and born in New Orleans
Get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly; Drake, Tunechi and Barbie
You know (You know)

Suck a cockpit prepare for landing
I'm branding, I ain't talking about Presley
I keep a sniper, I ain't talking about Wesley
Why these bitches so pressed be?
Open my trunk, all I gotta do is press B
I'ma violate your asses like Chris Stokes
I'm in Saint Tropez on a big boat
On my way to make a billi like a big goat
Pull my dick out in case you bitches get a slick throat
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
Won another round, willing get the ref
Got the clothing line popping and the wigs is next
When I fly you know G5 is the jet
I'm the motherfucking Queen 'lizabeth
Meetings with the president of every network
That is what the fuck I call how to network
My net worth, that net works
Keep my shooters out in Brooklyn where the Nets work
Chilling with executives
Check the charts,
All my winnings are consecutive
Trillion dollar deficit
But y'all don't hear me though
All you bitches deaf as shit
Bitches ain't got punchlines or flow
I have both and an empire also
Sell out shows out in Norway, Oslo
This is the Re-Up better cop it while the cost low
Flow's sick, I'll slap a patient
I'm checking these bitches like an application
Cause these bitches trippin' no navigation
So it's off with your head decapitation
Send em up in flames like a firemen
I do the hiring and I do the firing
That boss shit that you talk,
I live it
And I'm calling a travel
If you don't stay on your pivot, bitches
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher"

276,We Miss You,Nicki Minaj,"Why'd you have to leave in July
On a peaceful and serene summer night
I wish that you would have waited until September
Just a couple more memories to remember
I guess I have to pay you back to your lender
I guess I have to send you back to the sender
But then again maybe you gone til November
And maybe this is just part of the agenda
Why'd you have to go so soon?
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you
We miss you, we miss you
Why couldn't you come right home
When you seen the text message in your phone
I should have put my private? to come and find you
I coulda told you 'bout the niggas that's behind you
Could have told you all about my intuition
I could have even bought the extra ammunition
But now you mo-mo-mo-moved on so fuck you
Should've known from day one I couldn't trust you
Why would they take you from me
Why the doctors could not stop the bleeding
If you in a better place then you're free
Well then, why can't they make me believe it
You said that you will leave these streets
And I know you didn't mean in a body bag
But now you see you not bullet proof
And I'm mad 'cause you're the best that I've ever had
I'll never love again, I'll never love again
I'll never, I'll never, I'll never love again
I'll never love again, I'll never love again
I'll never, I'll never, I'll never love again
What would you suggest that I do now?
Why'd you leave
I hate you!"

Took everything from inside of me
Your silhouette in the doorway
But before you walk away
Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you'll be young forever
I'll be over here, you'll be over there
I'ma shed a tear but I really don't care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you'll be young forever
I used to think that we'd reunite
I'd be your wife, in the real life
I thought that you'd come back for me
And you would take me away
I never knew only as a teen
You'd reappear, only in my dream
Your silhouette in the doorway
But before you walk away
Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you'll be young forever
I'll be over here, you'll be over there
I'ma shed a tear but I really don't care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you'll be young forever
This is my last cry
Is this the only way?
This is my own prison
I'm frozen in time, in time, in time
Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember

And he keep a Du rag, keep his waves on swim.
W-w -aves on swim so they hate doin' him.
Anyway I think I met him sometime before.
In a different life or where I record I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve.
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree.
'S' on my chest cuz I am ready to save him.
Cuz I'm the one like I'm chasin' ma baby
And I think I love him, like I mean it's kinda shady
When he call me mama, Lil' mama, I call him baby.
Shawty Imma only tell you this once, you're the ill-est. (bah ba dah dah oh)
And for your lovin' Imma Die Hard like Bruce Willis. (bah ba dah dah oh)
You got spark, you-you got spunk.
You-you got something all the girls want.
You're like a candy store, and I'm a toddler.
You got me wantin' more and m-m-more of,
Your love, your love. (yeah) x4
Your love, your love. x4
(Yo, yo)
He they type to keep a couple hundred grand in the rubber band.
Just left Money Gram in the Lemon Lam.
Hot damn make me scream like summer jam.
I mean dat nigga must be from the motherland.
Anyway I think I met him in the sky When I was a Geisha he was a Samurai.
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai.
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly.
""S"" on my chest let me get my cape on.
With a certificate dat I changed ma name on
N-N-Name on, with a certificate dat I changed ma name on
Shawty Imma only tell you this once, you're the illest. (bah ba dah dah oh)
And for your lovin' Imma Die Hard like Bruce Willis. (bah ba dah dah oh)
You got spark, you-you got spunk.
You-you got something all the girls want.
You're like a candy store, and I'm a toddler.
You got me wantin' more and m-m-more of,
Your love, your love. (yeah) x4
Your love, your love. x4
Find me in the dark.
I'll be in the stars.
Find me in your heart.
I'm in need of your love."

Who told you that you stood a chance with this royalty?
You're so sweet, bless your heart
Can't let a pretty face distract me from business
And God as my witness, your ugly ass won't either
I'm sorry, 2 AM photos with smileys and hearts
Ain't the way to my juicy parts

But love isn't easy, so I'll do the hardest part

I never said I was perfect
Or you don't deserve a good person to carry your baggage
I know a few girls that can handle it
I ain't that kind of chick, but I can call 'em for you if you want
I never said that you wasn't attractive
Your style and that beard, ooh, don't get me distracted
I'm tryna be patient, and patience takes practice
The fact is I'm leaving, so just let me have this

No glory, let's go
Yeah, the old me used to love a Gemini
Like a threesome fuckin' with him every night
A lotta two-faced people show me both sides
So I figured out I gotta be my own type
They used to say, ""To get a man, you gotta know how to look""
They used to say, ""To keep a man, you had to know how to cook""
But I'm solo in Soho, sippin' Soju with Malibu
It's a me, myself kinda attitude
'Cause I'm my own soulmate
I know how to love me
I know that I'm always gonna hold me down
Yeah, I'm my own soulmate
No, I'm never lonely
I know I'm a queen, but I don't need no crown

And she never tell me to exercise
We always get extra fries
And you know the sex is fire
And I gotta testify
I get flowers every Sunday
I'ma marry me one day

The day I got the deal.
Chemically calm
Was I meant to feel happy
That my life was just about to change?
One life pretending to be
The cat who got the cream
Oh everybody said
""Marina is a dreamer.""
People like to tell you
What you're gonna be
It's not my problem if you don't see what I see
And I do not give a damn if you don't believe
My problem, it's my problem
That I never am happy
It's my problem, it's my problem
On how fast I will succeed
Are you satisfied with an average life?
Do I need to lie to make my way in life?
High achiever don't you see?
Baby nothing comes for free
They say I'm a control freak
Driven by a greed to succeed
Nobody can stop me!
Cos it's my problem
If I want to pack up and run away
It's my business if I feel
The need to smoke and drink and sway
It's my problem, it's my problem
If I feel the need to hide
And it's my problem if I have no friends and feel I want to die
Are you satisfied with an average life?
Do I need to lie to make my way in life?
Are you satisfied with an easy ride?
Once you cross the line, will you be satisfied?
Sad inside
In this life
Unsatisfied
Praying
Sad inside
In this life
Unsatisfied
Waiting

Sé que te gusto a ti todavía
Tres, dos, uno

Standing here in an empty room
I saw you there, and my blood ran cold
Take me back to that long September
Don't know how I ever let you go
I was young, didn't know 'bout love
You were wild, couldn't get enough
Gave my heart to another lover
Don't know how I ever let you go

Find me in another place and time
If only, if only you were mine
But I'm already someone else's baby

Guess I had my last chance
And now this is our last dance
You fell through the cracks in my hands
Hard to say it's over
But I'm already someone else's (C'mon)
Baby, ahh
Baby, ahh
Baby, ahh
I'm already someone else's

All caught up in the way we were
I feel your hands getting close to mine
Don't say the words that I love to hear
The beat goes on and I close my eyes
I was young, didn't know 'bout love
You were wild, couldn't get enough
Let's leave things the way they were
You'll stay with me like a lullaby

Hey
Sé que te gusto a ti todavía por mucho que digas
Además puedo ver en tus ojos que no sólo quieres quedar como amigos
Tienes mi corazón, eres mi obsesión
Soy tuyo pa' siempre

Guess I had my last chance
And now this is our last dance
You fell through the cracks in my hands
Tell myself be stronger
My heart's like a rubber band
And it's such a shame
You'll always be the one who got away
We both know that deep down you feel the same
Hard to say it's over
But I'm already someone else's (C'mon)
Baby, ahh
Eso no es amor
Baby, ahh
Mereces mejor, yeah
Baby, ahh
Quiero tu calor
I'm already someone else's

Wish I met you at another place and time
If only, if only you were mine
This love story ends for you and I
'Cause I'm already someone else's

Baby, ahh
Y lo digo otra vez
Baby, ahh
Mereces mucho mejor, mucho mejor
Baby, ahh
Lo que tienes con él (Con él) no es amor, no
I'm already someone else's
Baby, ahh
Cada noche más te extraño, cada día sin ti me hace daño
Baby, ahh
Sabes que mereces mejor, lo que sientes por él ya no es amor
Baby, ahh
Por mucho que digas somos más que amigos
I'm already someone else's
Y el tiempo se acaba en cuatro, tres, dos, uno"
307,Bad Kidz,Marina And The Diamonds,"We came to an agreement in good health
That if no-one would take care of us
We'd be fine by ourselves
It was time to fight abuse
Of those who don't deserve our spit
Why is it that we crave the praise
From the people who least deserve it
If you gave us a flower
We could sit and we'd water it
But instead we watch you weave your webs
And you wait for us to fly into it
You act like you're a strong ant
We all act like we're weak
If only you'd quit trying to cripple
Our dancing feet
Bad kids, bad kids
Slip through your hands like liquid
Bad kids, bad kids
Vanish when you shut your eyelids
They'll vanish when you shut your eyelids
Thinking of it is painful
It's better to accept it all
Thinking of all the mothers and the daughters
And the fathers and the sons
Who are waiting for a call
That says I didn't mean it
I love you for who you are
Whether you made it in this sick industry or not
You'll always be our special star
He said, if I became a pretty flower
Would you sit and talk to me?
Oh my roots, my roots are getting old
And I'm getting, I'm getting, I'm getting, lonely, lonely
I'll play Superman,
I'll make you feel safe
So why are you disappointed?
Everything that I did for you means nothing
Coz you've turned out to be wicked
Bad kids, bad kids
Vanish when you shut your eyelids
Bad kids, bad kids
Slip off your skin like liquid
Yeah, they slip off your skin like liquid
I'm a tangled ball of string
I'm a criminal, you're the victim
I am a cat and you are the mouse
And I am the milkmaid that killed all the cows
Am I the oil that stained the see?
Am I the storm that sunk the ship?
You are the horse on my cart
Persue, persue, persue
It's not me, it's not me, it's not me
That broke your heart
That broke your heart
That broke your heart
That broke your heart ah-ah-ah"

Just another in a long line of men she knew

Like all the boys before
Another dream come true
It's a power, it's a power, it's a power move
And while I'm not quite sure what she's trying to prove
They all say she's got low self-esteem
So, why is she looking like a cat who got the cream?

That the boys can taste 'til they're out of use
And she'll network 'til her dreams come true
Even if it means getting into bed with you
Everybody's friend, does it ring a bell?
I know a little too much but I'll never tell
But you, you can do better than

Better than that, ooh-ooh-ooh
Better than that, better than that
Better than that, ooh-ooh-ooh
Well, I guess it's just what humans do
up with other people 'til it all falls through
And when it's over, they go out and try and heal their pain
up with another lover, do it all again
I'm not passing judgment on her sexual life
I'm passing judgement on the way she always stuck her knife
In my back ever since we were starting out
Suspicious from the start, I always had my doubts about you
You can do better than
You can do better than that
I know you've been feeling sad
I've got no right to be mad, mad

mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm,
Got different people inside my head
I wonder which one I will like best
I'm done with trying to have it all
And ending up with having not much at all
mmm, mmm, mmm
Now the time is here,
Baby you don't have to live your life in the fear
And the sky is clear,
Is clear,
Of fear.
Don't want to live in fear and loathing
I want to feel like I am floating
Instead of constantly exploding
In fear and loathing
mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm,
And when the time comes along when the lights run out
I know a light will burn on when they blow me out.
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm."
320,Forget,Marina And The Diamonds,"Sometimes I think I'm not as strong
But there's a force that carries me on
Sick of my small heart, made of steel
Sick of the wounds that never heal (never heal)
Cause I have lived my life in debt
I've spent my days in deep regret
Yeah, I been living in the red
Oh, cause I can't forgive and I can't forget
Forget
Forget, forget
Forget, forget
Ain't no time for regret
Yeah, it's time to forget
Ever since I can remember
Life was like a tipping scale
Like an abacus I played with
Counting every win and fail (win and fail)
Cause I have lived my life in debt
I've spent my days in deep regret
Yeah, I've been living in the red
But I wanna forgive and forget
Forget, forget
Forget, forget
Ain't no time for regret
Yeah, it's time to be letting go
Oh, baby you know
What I'm talking about
Got nothing to lose and nothing to prove
Oh, baby, I'm bowing out
Out, I'm bowing out
Yeah, I've been dancing with the devil
I love that he pretends to care
If I'll ever get to heaven
When a million dollars gets you there
Oh, all the time that I have wasted
Chasing rabbits down a hole
When I was born to be the tortoise
I was born to walk alone
Forget about it
Forget about it
Forget about it
Forget, forget
Forget, forget
Ain't no time for regret
I'm gonna leave the past behind
I've had enough, I'm breaking free
No pressing stop, erase, rewind
That chain of thought that followed me
I've put my money where my mouth is
For the first time in my life
I've made mistakes but I believe that
Everything was worth the fight
Cause in the end, the road is long
But only cause it makes you strong
It's filled with peaks and twists and turns
Sometimes you have to learn to forget about it"

From winter sun to summer snow
This ain't my first time at the rodeo
Nature ain't a fruit machine
She's gotta keep her credits clean
Good things come to those who wait
But I ain't in a patient phase
It's summer time and I hang on a vine
They're gonna make me into sweet red wine
Hanging around like a fruit on a tree
Waiting to be picked, come on cut me free
Come on fill your cup up
Looking for some good luck
Good luck, good luck to you
Hanging like a fruit
Ready to be juiced
Juiced, juiced

Of all the calories they eat

Na, na, na, na, na

Of Girls Aloud, all the journos in heat

Making money off your insecurity and doubt

Hiding body parts
A broken dog, a broken leg
I left it cold, I left it dead

And know what I have done
Yeah, I'm a troubled one
And I won't be forgiven
Guilty on the run
And I know what I have done
Guilty on the run
And I'm never forgiven
I was just a kid
That you could not forgive
Because it's harder
I was just a kid
And all I really wanted
Was my father
I killed a dog so smart and rare
Touched his techni-coloured hair
I left it bruised and black and lame
I left it running full of shame
Oh I'm a guilty one
And know what I have done
Yeah, I'm a troubled one
And I won't be forgiven

I was just a kid
That you could not forgive
Because it's harder
I was just a kid
And all I really wanted
Was my father
Spent years singing to forget, (to forget)
Spent years singing, ""no regret""
Then suddenly it all becomes clear
I've been sorry all these years
I was just a kid
That you could not forgive
Because it's harder
I was just a kid
And all I really wanted
Was my father

325,Handmade Heaven,Marina And The Diamonds,"
I envy the birds high up in the trees
They live out their lives so purposefully
I envy the spiders, the squirrels and seeds
They all find their way automatically

But in this handmade heaven, I come alive
Bluebirds forever colour the sky
In this handmade heaven, we forget the time
'Cause birds of a feather fly together

I carry along a feel of unease
I want to belong like the birds in the trees
I sit on my own, look over the town
The skyscrapers glow like they'll never fall down

But in this handmade heaven, it's paradise
Bluebirds forever colour the sky
In this handmade heaven, we forget the time
'Cause birds of a feather fly together

In this handmade heaven, I come alive
Bluebirds forever colour the sky
In this handmade heaven, handmade heaven
Handmade heaven, handmade heaven

And I can no longer ignore
The ivy growing tall
This life don't suit me anymore
The writings on the wall

But in this handmade heaven, I come alive
Bluebirds forever colour the sky
In this handmade heaven, handmade heaven
Handmade heaven, handmade heaven

(Bluebirds forever) Birds of a feather
(Bluebirds forever) Fly together
(Bluebirds forever) In this strange, strange weather
(Bluebirds forever) In this handmade heaven
In this handmade heaven, in this handmade heaven
In this handmade heaven, in this handmade heaven"
326,Happy,Marina And The Diamonds,"Couldn't relax, couldn't sit back,
and let the sun light in my lap.
I sang a hymn to bring me peace,
and then it came, a melody
It felt so sweet, it felt so strong,
It made me feel like I belonged,
and all the sadness inside me melted away like I was free
I've found what I've been looking for in myself,
Found a life worth living for someone else,
Never thought that I could be, I could be happy, happy.
Don't go out much at all,
I've never been the type to call,
I realise to be happy maybe I need a little company
So now you know, you know it all,
That I've been des-desperately alone,
I haven't found the one for me
But I believe in divinity
I've found what I've been looking for in myself,
Found a life worth living for someone else,
Never thought that I could be, I could be happy, happy
I believe (I believe) in possibility,
I believe (I believe) someone's watching over me,
And finally (finally) I have found a way to be happy, happy
From the concrete to the coast,
I was looking for a holy ghost,
Like the land joining the sea,
Happiness it followed me
I believe (I believe) in possibility,
I believe (I believe) someone's watching over me,
And finally (finally) I have found a way to be happy, happy, happy."
327,Hermit The Frog,Marina And The Diamonds,"Yeah, I feel I'm watered down
Whenever he's around
I put on the crown of clowns
And melt slowly to the ground
Yeah, I feel it coming on
When I've been static for too long
And an explosion comes in time
Before I go and cross the line
They say, ""You used to be so kind
I never knew you had such a dirty mind!""
Well, I went to the doctors believing
The devil had control over me and
I was finding it hard to breathe and
Finding it hard to fight the feeling
When my heart just burst like a glass balloon
I'd let it fly too high and it shattered too soon
I was the wrong damn girl in the wrong damn room
I broke my glass balloon
I let go of my glass balloon
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh!
They call him Hermit the Frog
He's looking for a dog
Did you find your bitch in me?
Oh you're abominable socially
You're just a little bit too much like me
She says, ""she used to be so kind!""
Well, baby, I give you your dirty mind
Well I, I wanna tell you a secret
You can take your double standard love and keep it
I can't help the devil likes to make my heart a double bed
And I can't help he sometimes likes to come and rest his little head
When my heart just burst like a glass balloon
I'd let it fly too high and it shattered too soon
I was the wrong damn girl in the wrong damn room
I broke my glass balloon
I let go of my glass balloon
Oh my heart just burst like a glass balloon
We let them fly too high and they shattered too soon
Are we the wrong damn people in the wrong damn room?
We broke our glass balloons
We let go of our glass balloons
We broke our glass balloon
Let go of my glass balloon"

American queen is the American dream
She is a Polish girl in America
Tall, tanned, hot blond, called Anya
I asked her, ""Why would you wanna be a Hollywood wife?""
""Because I don't want to end up living in a dive on Vine""
You do anything for a dime
You're looking for the golden lie
Hollywood infected your brain
You wanted kissing in the rain, oh, oh
Living in a movie scene
Puking American dreams, oh, oh
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America, ooh
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America
A fat security making place for me
Soon as I touch down in old L.A
He said, ""Oh, my god, you look just like Shakira
No, no, you're Catherine Zeta!""
""Actually, my name's Marina""
Your mind is just like mine
All filled up with things benign
You're looking for the golden lie
Hollywood infected your brain
You wanted kissing in the rain, oh, oh

Puking American dreams, oh, oh

329,Homewrecker,Marina And The Diamonds,"Every boyfriend is the one, until otherwise proven
The good are never easy, the easy never good
And love, it never happens like you think it really should
Deception and perfection are wonderful traits
One will breed love, the other, hate
You'll find me in the lonely hearts
Under 'I'm after a brand new start'
And I don't belong to anyone
They call me homewrecker, homewrecker
They call me homewrecker, homewrecker
Girls and their curls and their gourmet vomit
Boys and their toys and their six inch rockets
We're all very lovely 'til we get to know each other
As we stop becoming friends and we start becoming lovers
And I don't belong to anyone
They call me homewrecker, homewrecker
(I'm only happy when I'm on the run)
They call me homewrecker, homewrecker
(I broke a million hearts just for fun)
They call me homewrecker, homewrecker
(I'm only happy when I'm on the run)
They call me homewrecker, homewrecker
(I broke a million hearts just for fun)
I'm only happy when I'm on the run
I break a million hearts just for fun
I don't belong to anyone
I guess you could say that my life's a mess
But I'm still looking pretty in this dress
I'm the image of deception
When everything is life and death
You may feel like there's nothing left
Instead of love and trust and laughter
What you get is happy never after
But deep down all you want is love
The pure kind we all dream of
But we cannot escape the past
So you and I will never last
Cause I'm a homewrecker, homewrecker
(I'm only happy when I'm on the ru-u-un)
Cause I'm a homewrecker, homewrecker

You were a lullaby, and you had me blind.
But now I laugh 'cause you're the one,
Who's being left behind, I see you cry
Now that the shoe's on the other foot.
Yeah.
Now that the shoe's on the other foot,
You suddenly decided to knock on wood,
Wakin' everybody in the neighborhood,
Tellin' everbody that I'm no good.
Karma came around like I knew it would,
Like I knew it would.
And it feels so good when the shoe is put,
On the other foot.
Yeah, baby, I know that it hurts,
When you're about to get your just desserts.
Oh heart breaks hard,
Harder than glittering cars,
Harder than livin' life fast,
Harder than crashin' and burnin',
Hope that you learned your lesson.
(I hope that you learned your lesson).
They always said I was a mess of a girl,
Ever since you stepped your toes into my perfect world.
You flipped me upside down but I see clear from here,
That you're a mess of a boy, you'll cry these tears for years,
Look in the mirror babe.
Now that the shoe's on the other foot.
Yeah.
Now that the shoe's on the other foot,
You suddenly decided to knock on wood,
Wakin' everybody in the neighborhood,
Tellin' everbody that I'm no good.
Karma came around like I knew it would,
Like I knew it would.
And it feels so good when the shoe is put,
On the other foot.
Yeah, baby, I know that it hurts,
When you're about to get your just desserts
I'm glad that you crashed and burned,
Guys like you they never learn, never learn.
Baby, revenge is sweet,
When I am playing you on repeat.
Now that the shoe's on the other foot,
You suddenly decided to knock on wood,
Wakin' everybody in the neighbourhood,
Tellin' everbody that I'm no good.
Karma came around like I knew it would,
Like I knew it would.
And it feels so good when the shoe is put,
On the other foot.
Now that the shoe's on the foot,
Karma came back like you knew it would,
Like you knew it would."

But really they're not

People are staring, time to go quick and
Skin is on fire, just choose something, something, something!

Facing one week without food
A day, a day, when things, things are pretty bad

And I grow cold...
And I grow cold...
When you're around me, I'm radioactive
My blood is burning, radioactive
I'm turning radioactive
My blood is radioactive
My heart is nuclear
Love is all that I fear
Ready to be let down

355,Rootless,Marina And The Diamonds,"I'm a cloud drifting by
Dripping tears from the sky
I'm a snail without a shell
Leper with a golden bell
I got nowhere to go
I'm a stray cat on the roam
Choking on a chicken bone
For a home-sweet, no sweet home
For a root
For a leaf
For a branch
For a tree
For something, somebody
That reminded them of me
Running with my roots pulled up
Caught me cold so they could cut
What there was left of love
I'm rootless
I'm rootless
Work you fingers to the bone
Building castles out of snow
I'm a nomad walking on
Humming to the same old song
Lowercase society
Tied to no community
A kingdom without a king
With no sense of belonging
For a root
For a leaf
For a branch
For a tree
For something, somebody
That reminded them of me
Running with my roots pulled up
Caught me cold so they could cut
What there was left of love
I'm rootless
I'm rootless
Running with my roots pulled up
So they could cut me free of love
Running with my roots pulled up
Caught me cold so they could cut
What there was left of love
I'm rootless
I'm rootless
Dragging my roots through the snow
No home-sweet and no sweet home
I've got nowhere to go

356,Savages,Marina And The Diamonds,"Murder lives forever
And so does war
It's survival of the fittest
Rich against the poor
At the end of the day
It's a human trait
Hidden deep down inside of our DNA
One man can build a bomb
Another run a race
To save somebody's life and have it blow up in his face
I'm not the only one who finds it hard to understand
I'm not afraid of God
I am afraid of man
Is it running in our blood?
Is it running in our veins?
Is it running in our genes?
Is it in our DNA?
Humans aren't gonna behave as we think we always should
Yeah, we can bad as we can be good
Underneath it all we're just savages
Hidden behind shirts, ties and marriages
How could we expect anything at all?
We're just animals still learning how to crawl
We live, we die
We steal, we kill, we lie
Just like animals
But with far less grace
We laugh, we cry
Like babies in the night
Forever running wild
In the human race
Another day, another tale of rape
Another ticking bomb to bury deep and detonate
I'm not the only one who finds it hard to understand
I'm not afraid of God
I am afraid of man
You can see it on the news
You can watch it on TV
You can read it on your phone
You can say it's troubling
Humans aren't gonna behave as we think we always should
Yeah, we can be bad as we can good
Underneath it all we're just savages
Hidden behind shirts, ties and marriages
How could we expect anything at all?
We're just animals still learning how to crawl
Underneath it all we're just savages
Hidden behind shirts, ties and marriages
Truth is in us all, cradle to the grave
We're just animals still learning to behave
All the hate coming out from a generation
Who got everything and nothing guided by temptation
Were we born to abuse, shoot a gun and run
Or has something deep inside of us come undone?
Is it a human trait or is it learned behaviour
Are you killing for yourself or killing for your saviour?
Underneath it all, we're just savages
Hidden behind shirts, ties and marriages
How could we expect anything at all?
We're just animals still learning how to crawl
Underneath it all we're just savages
Hidden behind shirts, ties and marriages
Truth is in us all, cradle to the grave
We're just animals still learning to behave"
357,Scab And Plaster,Marina And The Diamonds,"I stepped into a room of clocks that all told different times
I stepped into a mirrored world that mirrored all our crimes
You keep picking at the scab and I'll keep selling the plaster
You keep telling me that I'm bad
But I keep on getting better faster
You hold me down and you hold me up
You can't communicate
You brought me up just to bring me down
I've nothing left to say
I've lost, I've lost my innocence
I've found my self-belief
And in a cup of loneliness
I've found instant relief
You hold me down, you hold me up
Oh Daddy, are we out of luck?
You brought me up to bring me down
You shut me in, you shut me up

You brought me up to bring me down
You shut me in, you shut me up
I've lost, I've lost my confidence

The rise of a king and the fall of a queen

Oh, you were embarrassed of me
'Cause I used my tongue freely
Bet you wish I couldn't speak
'Cause when I do you know I tell you why you appear weak
You want a hassle free life?
Go get your upper class wife
She's got all the personality, oh
Of a lemon that has been truly sucked dry
You teach me how to behave
I felt you question the way-ay
I was brought up as a baby
Well, you don't know fuck about my family
Could never tell you what happened
The day I turned seventeen

Trying to hide the hole inside my head
Watching the stars slide down to reach the end
Cause sleep is not my friend
Drinking champagne to forget yesterday
Cause I remember, the way, the way, the way
It ended the day, the day, the day, the day
That I walked away, away, away, away
Drinking champagne, made by the angel
Who goes by the name of Glittering Gabriel
Drinking champagne made of an angel's
Tears and pain, but I feel celestial
Elderly stars slide down the morning sky
Slipping away to find a place to die
I wonder when the night will reach its end
Cause sleep is not my friend
Drinking champagne, meant for a wedding
Toast to the bride, a fairytale ending
Drinking champagne, a bottle to myself
Savour the taste of fabricated wealth
Drinking champagne, made by the angel
Who goes by the name of Glittering Gabriel
Drinking champagne made of an angel's
Tears and pain, but I feel celestial
Celestial, celestial, celestial, celestial
Drinking champagne, made by the angel
Who goes by the name of Glittering Gabriel

It seems so sinful
Living like a porcine
I know your dreaming of
The time when you were mine
It seems so sinful
It seems so sinful
Oooooh
You kicked me out
And hung the rope
From the roof
The Christians came out
And watched me tie my noose
I spoke a silent prayer
And began cryin'
They knew I lied to the
Hell I got in
It seems so sinful
Living like a porcine
I know your dreaming of
The time when you were mine

I know it hurts to be kind
I know that when love is lost
It's only fear in disguise

The truth is you have to be soft to be strong
Finally I feel the fear is gone
I found out love has to be soft to be strong
Soft to be strong
Soft
I believe the world is beautiful
Only the weak ones are cruel
I choose to love you without fear
No shame in being sincere
And I guess I've known it all along
The truth is you have to be soft to be strong
Finally I feel the fear is gone
I found out love has to be soft to be strong
Soft to be strong
And I made myself believe other people wanted to hurt me
Took my bitterness and made it sweet
I took a broken heart and made it beat
Somebody hurt me long ago
And though to heal a heart is slow
It's just a consequence of pain
There is no use in laying blame
And I guess I've known it all along
The truth is you have to be soft to be strong

You don't love me, not a big deal

(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Still, I don't know, don't know what it means
To be human, a real human being

I like to think about how we all look from afar
People driving fancy cars look like beetles to the stars
The missiles and the bombs sound like symphonies gone wrong
And if there is a God, they'll know why it's so hard

To be human
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
To be hu-
Still, I don't know, don't know what it means
To be human, a real human being

(To be human)
I want connection, ooh
I wanna feel human again
(To be human)
Lost my direction, ooh
I wanna feel human again
To be human, to be human
To be human, to be human"

I can't pretend, I can't pretend
Been feeling like I don't belong and I see
I've reached an end, I've reached an end

I hate this city, but I stay 'cause of you
Why, well, why can't I change?
I wanna move on, but I'm just too afraid

We sleep
Got a hole inside of me

Built with a heart, broken from the start
And now I die slow

Got a hole inside of me

And I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch
And try to come to life
Jump in the shower
And the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street
The traffic starts jumpin'
The folks like me on the job from 9 to 5
Workin' 9 to 5,
What a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by
It's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind
And they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy
If you let it
9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I
Would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead
But the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
They let you dream
Just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step
On the boss-man's ladder
But you got dreams
He'll never take away
You're in the same boat
With a lot of your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
'N' the tide's gonna turn
And it's all gonna roll your way

There's a better life
And you think about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game
No matter what they call it

Puttin' money in his wallet

378,A Christmas To Remember,Dolly Parton,"You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Strangers meet and they willingly surrender
Oh! What a Christmas to remember.
Almost went to Aspen but something told me no
I considered Mammoth but there wasn't enough snow
And I even thought of Gatlinburg but that seemed so far to go
So I headed up to Tahoe for a Christmas on the slopes.
And I had fantasized about Christmas in this way
Curled up by a fireplace in a Tahoe ski chalet
With a fast talking lover and some slow burning wood
But even in my wildest dreams it never got this good.
And you've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Change the radio and I'll turn the lights down dimmer
Oh, oh, what a Christmas to remember.
Strangers when we met, lovers as we leave
Christmas to remember, too good to believe
Don't know how or when, but I know we'll meet again
We'll come blowin' back to somewhere like some wild restless winter's wind.
You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Neath the mistletoe you kissed me warm and tender
Oh! What a Christmas to remember.
We loved and laughed and played and joked
Sang Christmas songs and talked to folks
Sleighed the fields and skied the slopes then to the lodge for dinner
But now it's time for us to go as our hearts melt like chimney snow
There's just one thing I want to know san we do this next winter.
Oh, oh, what a Christmas to remember
You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Though the fire is hot, we'll just have to let it simmer.
Oh, oh, what a Christmas to remember
You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Though it's cold outside we'll just stroke the burning embers.
Oh, oh, what a Christmas to remember..."
379,A Cowboys Ways,Dolly Parton,"Sometimes he gets crazy as men are known to do
He'll lose his head in spite of everything he stands to lose
What is it in a man that makes him act like such a fool
She swears she never knew but always needed to.
But stubborn pride is just the way of cowboys I suppose
Even love can't change the things he ought to change the most
And it's pride that keeps him standing when he should be on his knees
Makin' apologies but she loves him desperately.
Oh, but now and again she wished he'd been a poet
So he'd know all the perfect lines to say
And have some great romantic way to show it
Be the hero ridin' up to save the day.
And go ridin' high like a knight in shinin' armor
To sweep her up and carry her away
Oh, but he don't have no magic ways to charm her
No, 'cause even love can't change a cowboy's ways.
""I love you"" and ""I'm sorry"" are words that just don't come
'Cause words like that are no match for the kind that rule his tongue
But his eyes keep tellin' her you know I love you anyway
No matter what I say or what I never say.
Oh, but now and again she wished he'd been a poet
So he'd know all those fancy lines to say
And have some great romantic way to show it
Be the hero ridin' up to save the day.
And go ridin' high like a knight in shinin' armor
And sweep her up and carry her away
Oh, but he don't have no magic ways to charm her
No, 'cause even love can't change a cowboy's ways.
His ways seem cold but she knows he's much warmer
But even love can't change a cowboy's ways.

He's just a fool that must defend his honor
But even love can't change a cowboy's ways..."
380,A Few Old Memories,Dolly Parton,"(Hazel Dickens)
Just a few old memories 
Slipped in through my door 
Though I thought I had closed it 
So tightly before 
I can't understand it 
Why it should bother my mind 
For it all belongs to another place and time 
Just a few old keep-sakes 
Way back on the shelf 
No, they don't mean nothin' 
Well I'm surprised they're still left 
Just a few old love letters 
With the edges all brown 
And an old faded picture 
I keep turned upside-down 
Just a few old memories 
Going way back in time 
Well I can hardly remember 
I don't know why I'm cryin' 
I can't understand it 
Well I'm surprised myself 
First thing tomorrow morning 
I'll clean off that shelf 
Just a few old keep-sakes 
Way back on the shelf 
No, they don't mean nothin' 
Well I'm surprised that they're left 
Just a few old love letters 
With their edges all brown 
And an old faded picture 
I keep turned upside-down"

Or we can be so real and still pretend
And read different yet to say, different rocks and different names
And is the just the coolest thing that we are best friends

382,A Habit I Cant Break,Dolly Parton,"Loving you isn't good for me
You keep my tears flowing
If I left you I couldn't stay gone
So there's no use in going
Loving you is a habit I can't break
I haven't found a way yet
But I've been trying
To stop loving you but I can't wait
There's no use in lyin'
Loving you is a habit I can't break
Loving you is a habit I can't break
I've been loving you much too long now
To change the way I feel
So I might as well get used to these heartaches
Loving you is a habit I can't break"
383,Act Like A Fool,Dolly Parton,"You make me act like a fool
You treat me mean and cold and cruel
You make me do things that I hate to do
Why do you make me act like a fool?
Now that you know just how much I care
You treat me mean and it ain't right nor fair
I keep holdin' on though I don't know what to
While you make me act like a fool
You know just how to hurt me and you often do
When we're out in public I start fightin' with you
You start trouble in private when nobody knows
Oh, then you go away smellin' just like a rose
Though you make me act like a fool
You treat me mean cold and cruel
You make me do things that I hate to do
Oh, why must you make me act like a fool?
You know just how to hurt me as you often do
You start flirtin' in public with somebody new
You start trouble in private when nobody knows
Oh then you go away smellin' just like a rose
Though you make me act like a fool
You treat mean and cold and cruel
You make me do things that I hate to do
Oh but why do you make, oh why do I let you
Make me look like a fool?"

386,Alabama Sundown,Dolly Parton,"The cold December wind seems bent on rockin' New York City
The town that's got me down to my last dime
And everywhere I go, the people seem in such a hurry
To keep this Mobile girl from feelin' fine
Chorus:
Lord, what I'd give to see an Alabama sundown
The sun just seemed to drop in Mobile Bay
New York town has got a gifted way to keep a girl down
But that never was the Mobile way, no, no
That never was the Mobile way
A flashing sign says that you can rent a bed for just a dollar
In anybody's town, that price is cheap
It's a shame to know a girl would ever fall down to my standards
'Cause I need ninety cents to go to sleep
Repeat Chorus
I felt so big the day I left that Mobile couldn't hold me
I thought there had to be a better way
But if I could find that man that first called Lady Luck a lady
That gentleman would surely learn to pray
Repeat Chorus Twice & Fade"

All I can do to keep from letting it show
Yeah it's all I can do to keep from falling in love with you

Find the saddest eyes you've ever seen
Find someone who's always longing for you

Will your love be as strong

Darling will you stay with me forever always always
Will your love remain through stormy weather always always

To walk the roads that might get rough always always
In return for your love I'll be true as stars above always always
And the love that I feel will forever be so real always always"
391,Always The First Time,Dolly Parton,"Now I've never stepped through the doors of a barroom
Or tasted the flavor of wine
And I've never danced to the songs on a jukebox
Or held someone that wasn't mine.
But there's always the first time
And if you don't change
Then I guess the first time
Can't be arranged, can't be arranged.
Now I've never dressed for the eyes of a stranger
To sow seeds of lust in his mind
And I've never walked down backroad of temptation
To leave dirty footprints behind.
But there's always the first time
And if you don't change
Then I guess the first time
Can't be arranged, can't be arranged..."
392,Amazing Grace,Dolly Parton,"(Traditional)
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see
Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed
Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come
Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see
Amazing grace, oh amazing grace
That saved a wretch like me
Oh amazing grace, amazing grace"
393,Anyplace You Want To Go,Dolly Parton,"Crushed velvet drapes the walls of the room
Pillows all colors shapes and sizes on the floor
Mirrors on the ceiling reflect the candles burning low
Just close your eyes and travel anyplace you want to go
To lover's lane or far away to the mountain peaks of Spain
Crise along the Amazon where the deep blue waters flow
Our imagination will take us anyplace you want to go

Though we can only go there in our minds
Cause we cannot afford such luxuries so kind
The little room we live in is not much we both know
But the dreams we share can take us anyplace we want to go
Tonight we'll go to some majestic island
Ride the waves when the tie is rising
Lying in the silver sands where gentle breezes blow
The beauty of our love can take anyplace we want to go
To lover's lane or far away...
Anyplace you want to go"
394,Appalachian Memories,Dolly Parton,"You oughta go north somebody told us
'Cause the air is filled with gold dust
And fortune falls like snow flakes in your hands
Now I don't recall you said it
But we'd lived so long on credit
And so we headed out to find our promised land
Just poor Appalachian farm folk
With nothing more than high hopes
We hitched our station wagon to a star
But our dreams all fell in on us
'Cause there was no land of promise
And it's a stuggle keepin' sight of who you are
Oh and these northern nights are dreary
And my southern heart is weary
I wonder how the old folks are back home
But I'll keep leanin' on sweet Jesus
I know He'll love and guide and lead us
Appalachian memories keep me strong
Ya know I've been thinkin' a whole lot lately
About what's been and what awaits me
It takes all I've got to give what life demands
You go insane if you give in to it
Life's a mill and I've been through it
I'm just thankful I'm creative with my hands
Oh and these northern nights are dreary
And my southern eyes are teary
Don't I wonder how the old folks are back home
But I'll keep leanin' on my Jesus
I know he'll love and guide and lead us
Appalachian memories keep me strong
I'll keep lookin' to the Father
Keep our heads above the water
Appalachian memories keep me strong"
395,Applejack,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
He lived by the apple orchard in this little orchard shack 
His real name was Jackson Taylor but I called him AppleJack 
Now old AppleJack was loved by everyone he ever knew 
AppleJack picked apples but he picked the banjo too 
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack 
Play a song for me and I'll sing 
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack 
Play a song, let your banjo ring 
Now I'd go down to AppleJack's almost everyday 
We'd sit and we'd drink applejack that old AppleJack had made 
Then he'd take his banjo down then he'd ask me if I'd sing 
And he would play the banjo and I'd play my tambourine 
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack 
Play a song for me and I'll sing 
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack 
Play a song, let your banjo ring 
That's when I was just a kid and now that I am grown 
All I have are memories, old AppleJack is gone 
Oh but he left me his banjo and it always takes me back 
And everytime I play it I still hear AppleJack 
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack 
Play a song for me and I'll sing 
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack 
Play a song, let your banjo ring 
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack 
Play a song for me and I'll sing 
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack 
Play a song, let your banjo ring 
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack 
Play a song for me and I'll sing 
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack 
Play a song, let your banjo ring"

Hurt is no stranger to me

But I always forgive 
And I'll hurt for as long as I love you 
And I'll love you for as long as I live

398,As Much As Always,Dolly Parton,"I hoped I wouldn't miss you long
But I still can't believe you're gone
And I still miss you just as much as always
I hoped I'd get you off my mind
It's been a long time but I find
That I still think of you as much as always
As much as always, as much as always
Just as much as always
As much as always just as much as always
I still miss you, still think of you
Just as much as always, as much as always

But there's too much of you still left
And I still love you, just as much as always

399,As Soon As I Touched Him,Dolly Parton,"He came to me like a bright idea
Shining like the sun
And the way his eyes burned into mine
I knew he must be the one
Oh, he drew me in like a magnet does
So I couldn't pull away
But the kind of lovin' that I gave to him
I'm not ashamed to say
1st Chorus:
Oh, as soon as I touched him
Soon as I touched him
I felt like a woman
And the feelin' made me close my eyes
I was born again
An' I heard myself cryin'
Like a new born baby cries
He told me what I meant to him
Swore that I was sent to him
All my lovin' went to him
Now he's gone, oh, he's gone
Now I hide myself from the light of day
So no one else can see
A part of him that I can't forget
That's growin' deep inside of me
2nd Chorus:
Oh, as soon as I touched him
Soon as I touched him
I felt like a woman
And the feelin' made me close my eyes
I was born again
An' I heard myself cryin'
Like our new born baby cries
Fade:
Repeat 1st Chorus"
400,Baby Come Out Tonight,Dolly Parton,"Baby, won't you come out tonight
Just come up the hill
'Cause there's a full moon on the risin'
Hey baby, can't you steal away
You know I really need to see you tonight
I just got word you was packin' it in
What's the matter
This old town got you crazy again
I can see the sad look in your eyes
But I don't know how to say goodbye
And tommorrow, you're gonna have your day
Take your wife and you're gonna run away
Baby while I'm wailin'
You'll be sailin' like a hog across the bay singin'
Ooo, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Mmmmm, baby, won't you come out tonight
Oh baby, won't you come out tonight
We'll run up the hill and we'll dance in the moonlight
Let me gaze into your eyes 'til we both go blind
Oh baby, can I see you tonight
I'm just tryin' to find a way to make it last
Good friends, they seem to slip away so fast
An' I know we're both headed down seperate tracks
An' when ya' go, baby don't look back
There won't be no more sleepin' over on a Tuesday night
No more runnin' to the races for a dark horse at midnight
No more dancin' after hours
Singin' in the showers
Or clingin' to each other in the soft mornin' light singin'
Ooo, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Oh baby, won't ya' come out tonight
Oh baby, won't ya' come out tonight
I'll meet ya' on the corner
And you'll be there at midnight
Oh baby, can you steal away
You know I really want to see ya' tonight
Ooo baby, can you come out tonight
We'll run up the hill and dance again in the moonlight
Oh baby, can you steal away
I really wanna see you tonight
Fade:
Oh baby, won't ya' come out tonight
Come up the hill
There's a full moon on the rise
Oh baby, can ya' steal away
Baby, won't ya' come out tonight
Oooooo..."
401,Baby Im Burnin,Dolly Parton,"You look at me that way I know what your eyes say
Your eyes reflect love and desire
I see that you need me I need you to please me
You touch me and set me on fire
The way that you love me the way that you touch me
The way that you whisper my name
I cannot resist you each time I kiss you
Then everything goes up in flames
Baby I'm burnin' out of control baby I'm burnin' body and soul
Hot as a pistol that flamin' desire baby I'm burnin' you've got me on fire
I'm on fire
This red hot emotion puts fireworks in motion
It looks like the 4th of July
There's no use in fighting this fire you've ignited
Just stand back and watch the sparks fly
Baby I'm burnin' out of control...
Baby I'm burnin' baby I'm burnin' baby I'm burnin' baby I'm burnin'
Baby I'm burnin' out of control...
Baby I'm burnin' out of control..."
402,Baby Sister,Dolly Parton,"Baby sister what a waste to see you in this place
I lose my mind from worrying over you
In a bar room filled with people all higher than a steeple
But I know why you do the things you do
And I curse the man that made you what you are today
I hope he dies a thousand times a thousand ways
Your eyes are filled with tears, sis lets get out of here
Cause I love you baby sister, lets go home
And I curse the man that made you what you are today
I hope he dies a thousand times a thousand ways
Your eyes are filled with tears, sis lets get out of here
Cause I love you baby sister, lets go home
Cause I love you baby sister, lets go home"
403,Back Home,Dolly Parton,"Back home, back home
Yes, I'm going back home
Why I can't believe it's been this long
Since I've seen mom and dad
When I left my mountain home behind
I left them both so sad
My brothers and my sisters that were babies then are grown
Years have past and now at last, I'm on my way back home
Back home, back home
Yes I'm going back home
To the factory smoke and city life, I'm sayin' so long
I've shed a lot of tears through all the years that I've been gone
And I've spent a lot of time a' wishin' I could go back home
I got a letter from mama an'
Mama asked me if I'd come back home
She says it sure is lonesome now
Since all of us kids are all growed up and gone
I just can't hardly stand the thoughts of
Momma and daddy being left there all alone
That's really all I need to know
And now I'm on the road back home
Back home, back home
Yes, I'm going back home
To the smog an' smoke an' city life, I'm sayin' so long
I've shed a lot of tears through all the years that I've been gone
And I've spent a lot of time a' wishin' I could go back home
Back home, back home
Yes, I'm going back home"
404,Backwoods Barbie,Dolly Parton,"I grew up poor and ragged, just a simple country girl. 
I wanted to be pretty more than anything in the world, 
like Barbie or the models in the Fredricks' catalog. 
From rags to wishes in my dreams I could have it all. 
I'm just a backwoods Barbie, too much makeup, too much hair. 
Don't be fooled by thinkin' that the goods are not all there. 
Don't let these false eyelashes lead you to believe that 
I'm as shallow as I look 'cause I run true and deep. 
I've always been misunderstood because of how I look. 
Don't judge me by the cover 'cause I'm a real good book. 
So read into it what you will, but see me as I am. 
The way I look is just a country girl's idea of glam. 
I'm just a backwoods Barbie in a push-up bra and heels. 
I might look artificial, but where it counts I'm real. 
And I'm all dolled up and hopin' for a chance to prove my worth, 
And even backwoods Barbie's get their feelings hurt. 
I'm just a backwoods Barbie, too much makeup, too much hair. 
Don't be fooled by thinkin' that the goods are not all there. 
Yes, I can see where I could be misjudged upon first glance; 
But even backwoods Barbie's deserve a second chance. 
I'm just a backwoods Barbie just asking for a chance, 
just a backwoods Barbie."
405,Banks Of The Ohio,Dolly Parton,"I went into his prison cell
To write his story, if he'd tell
He spoke as tears, fell from his eyes
And he told me when, and how and why
And he said
I asked my love to take a walk
Just to walk, a little ways
And as we walked, then we could talk
About our future wedding day
But when she said, she could never be mine
Well I held a knife against her breast
As into my arms she pressed
She cried ""my love, don't you murder me
'Cause I'm not prepared for eternity""
Then only say that you'll be mine
And in no others' arms entwine
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio
I started home twixt twelve and one
I cried, ""My God, what have I done?""
I've killed the one I love tonight
Because she would not be my bride
Well only say that you'll be mine
And in no others' arms entwine
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio
Down by the banks of the Ohio
Save my soul Lord
Save my soul
There beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio

406,Barbara On Your Mind,Dolly Parton,"Last night you called me Barbara
As you lay fast asleep
And although I'm not Barbara
You wanted me to be
You whispered words I haven't heard
In such a long, long time
Last night you said I love you
With Barbara on your mind
Sometimes I find traces of her kisses on your skin
And strands of chestnut hair
That say you've been with her again
Little traces of her that it breaks my heart to find
Last night you called me darlin'
With Barbara on your mind
With Barbara on your mind
You held me in your arms so tight
And lying there so close to you
I cried until day light
And though you think that I don't know
I'm really not that blind
Last night you said I love you
With Barbara on your mind
Last night you called me darlin'
With Barbara on your mind"
407,Because I Love You,Dolly Parton,"I lie in bed beside you and watch you while you sleep
And wonder who I was before I loved you
Lying here beside you feeling so complete
Thinking how I love and need and trust you
Because I love you I'm a brand new person now because you love me
I can face the world and have the cause I love you
Because you love me because I love you

Sweeter even still is knowing that you're lying there
And let you soon awake and reach to hold me
And anyway you want me that's the way that I am yours
Love as strong as this lets you control me
Because I love you...
Because I love you..."
408,Before Our Weakness Gets Too Strong,Dolly Parton,"What are we doing in this place alone
Is our desire to relive our past this strong
The love we knew in the past is gone but our weakness lingers on
Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong
Long ago we let the flame of love burn out of control
Now we have no reason to reach for love that has grown cold
If we live our past in the present our future will be gone
Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong

Line with temptation we raced into the past
On a road too small to let the past and the present pass
Are we going too fast to turn back and leave the past alone
Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong
Long ago we let the flame...
Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong"
409,Before The Next Teardrop Falls,Dolly Parton,"If she brings you happiness
Then I wish you both the best
It's your happiness that matters most of all
But if she ever breaks your heart
If the teardrops ever start
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
Though it hurts to let you go
Darling I want you to know
I'll run to you if ever you should call
And if I should ever hear
That she's made you shed a tear
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
I'll be there anytime you need me by your side
To dry away each teardrop you've cried

If she ever leaves you blue
Just remember I love you
And I'll be there
Before the next teardrop falls
Alli estare candor me necesites a tu lado
Para borrar cadda lagrima que haya llorado
If he ever leaves you blue
Just remember I love you
And I'll be there
Before the next teardrop falls
I'll be there, I'll be there
Before the next teardrop falls"
410,Behind Closed Doors,Dolly Parton,"My baby makes me proud
Lord, don't he make me proud
He never makes a scene
Hangin' all over me in a crowd
'Cause people like to talk
Lord, don't they love to talk
But when they turn out the lights
I know he'll be leavin' with me
Chorus:
And when we get behind closed doors
Then we let out hair hang down
Then he makes me glad that he's my man
And no one knows what goes on behind closed doors
My baby makes me smile
Lord, don't he make me smile
I'm never far away
Or too tired to say I want to
I'm purring like a kitten
When e's out in public with me
But when they turn out the lights
He brings out the tiger in me
Repeat Chorus
Tag:
Behind closed doors"

413,Better Day,Dolly Parton,"Now we don't know what heaven looks like,
But we've seen enough hell right here and right now,
But when the road is the roughest,
And the problems are the toughest,
Or when the times are the hardest,
Or that ol' sky turns the darkest,
You gotta keep the faith
Cause I believe there's a better day.
And those ol' blues?
Why they're gonna just roll right on away,
I know they are,
Listen to me!
All this blue ain't sky and sea,
Some of that blue's bound to get on me,
But the blues don't come to stay,
They'll move away
On a better day!
Troubles and woes, and misery
Ain't gonna give 'em the best of me
Lift the shades,
Fix my gaze
On a better day!
Clear the way!
Better days just up ahead,
When sorrow ain't sleeping in my bed,
And people ain't messing with my head,
There's a better way,
There's a brighter day!
Oh there's a better day,
With clearer sky,
Hope and promise on the rise,
Oh, the future, well, it's looking bright
On a better day,
Look away, look away.
Oh... ohohohoho hmmmm
There's a better day!
Oh better days just up ahead,
When sorrow ain't sleeping in my bed,
And people ain't messing with my head,
There's a better day,
There's a better day!
Oh all this blue it ain't sky and sea,
Some of that blue's gonna fall on me,
Oh, the future's looking bright,
There's a better day!
Look away, look away."
414,Better Get To Livin,Dolly Parton,"People always comin' up to me and askin'
""Dolly, what's your secret?
With all you do, your attitude
Just seems to be so good
How do you keep it?""
Well, I'm not the Dalai Lama, but I'll try
To offer up a few words of advice.
Chorus:
You better get to livin', givin'
Don't forget to throw in a little forgivin'
And lovin' on the way
You better get to knowin', showin'
A little bit more concerned about where you're goin'
Just a word unto the wise
You better get to livin'.
A girlfriend came to my house
Started cryin' on my shoulder Sunday evening
She was spinnin' such a sad tale
I could not believe the yarn that she was weavin'
So negative the words she had to say
I said if I had a violin I'd play.
I said you'd better get to livin', givin'
Be willing and forgivin'
Cause all healing has to start with you
You better stop whining, pining
Get your dreams in line
And then just shine, design, refine
Until they come true
And you better get to livin'.
Your life's a wreck, your house is mess
And your wardrobe way outdated
All your plans just keep on falling through
Overweight and under paid, under appreciated
I'm no guru, but I'll tell you
This I know is true.
You better get to livin', givin'
A little more thought about bein'
A little more willin' to make a better way
Don't sweat the small stuff
Keep your chin up
Just hang tough
And if it gets too rough
Fall on your knees and pray
And do that everyday
Then you'll get to livin'.
The day we're born we start to die
Don't waste one minute of this life
Get to livin'
Share your dreams and share your laughter
Make some points for the great hereafter.
Better start carin'
Better start sharin'
Better start tryin'
Better start smiling
And you better get to livin'..."
415,Better Move It On Home,Dolly Parton,"I've been sittin' here a' looking at the clock big daddy
Already you're a half-hour late
I've been a' pulling back the curtains, peeping out the window
Wish you wouldn't make me wait
You better move it on home, boy
You better move it on home
Been a' sittin' here listening to the jukebox playing
And forgettin' where I ought to be
Sipping on a cool one, having me some good fun
Time got away from me
I better move it on home
Better move it on home
Baby, spin them wheels and make it on back
Where heaven on earth and love is at
Like a rolling stone
Better move it on home, yeah
I've been here a' cooking you a nice hot supper
And you can't even eat it on time
Heatin' up the meat loaf and stirring up the gravy
It's kinda got to messin? up my mind
You better move it on home, boy
You better move it on home, yeah
Been a' speeding through the traffic, passing everyone
I remember what I forgot
Stepping on the gas and driving kind of fast
Hoping I won't get stopped
Better move it on home
Better move it on home
Baby, spin them wheels and make it on back
Where heaven on earth and love is at
Like a rolling stone
Better move it on home
Baby, spin them wheels and make it on back
Where heaven on earth and love is at
Like a rolling stone
Better move it on home, yeah
Better move it on home, daddy
You're running just a little shade late
I'm on my way baby, this traffic is murder
Ah, that's what I thought
That's what it's gonna be at home
If you don't get here soon
Traffic's a' messing up my mind
You're messing up mine"
416,Better Part Of Life,Dolly Parton,"If a picture paints a thousand words then why can't I paint you
The words will never show the you I've come to know
If a face could launch a thousand ships then where am I to go
There's no one home but you you're all that's left me to
And when my love for life is running dry
You come and pour yourself on me
If I could be two places at one time I'd be with you
Tomorrow and today beside you all the way
If the world should stop revolving spinning slowly down to die
I'd spend the end with you and when the world was through
Then one by one the stars would all go out
Then you and I would simply fly away

If a picture paints a thousand words then why can't I paint you
Cause the words will never show the you I've come to know
Then one by one the stars would all go out
Then you and I would simply fly away fly away"
417,Big Wind,Dolly Parton,"(Wayne P. Walker - Alex Zanetis - George McCormick)
Big wind, big wind's comin'.
From daylight till dusk we've been a workin' in the dust
Pickin' cotton workin' side by side
Oh, I can't forget I still remember yet
The way my daddy looked at me and cried.
Big wind's a comin', listen to the hummin'
Hurry up now be quick don't stall
You know we can't be slow take the kids and get below
If we don't hurry it'll surely get us all.
I ran across the field so scared my lips was scaled
To warn my mom to storm was on its way
Now I knew I'd won the race when I'd see my mama's face
And the way she looked at me and said.
Big wind's a comin', listen to the hummin'
Hurry up now be quick don't stall
You know we can't be slow take the kids and get below
If we don't hurry it'll surely get us all.
--- Instrumental ---
Oh, but dad was on the cellar and by now the sky was yellow
The wind was blowin' trees were fallin'
And outside I heard him cryin' and as he lay there dyin'
It seemed I could still hear him sayin'.
Big wind's a comin', listen to the hummin'
Hurry up now be quick don't stall
You know we can't be slow take the kids and get below
If we don't hurry it'll surely get us all.
Big wind, big wind's comin'..."
418,Bird That Never Flew,Dolly Parton,sometimes we feel the power of gods great hands are failed by some not worthy while those who sing and praise god's name seem to be passed by but worthy or not god loves us all or even a little bird that couldn't fly why is life given and taken away to soon for some to tell and others live for many years and walk a path to hell a cripple at birth may speak gods name and tender tongues with pain while a man with hell ends well or take gods name in vein but gods reasons may not be known or questioned by me and you like the little bird i saw like the bird that never flew i feel close to each name god made the earth the sky the sea and each creature living here belongs to him even you and me and one day when i was walking along i saw some of gods beautiful things by the path by which i walked i saw a small bird that had no wings so i sat down and held out my hand and that little bird climbed on and i held him for a long long time i thought that maybe his mom might come and he looked at me and thought he might of found him a friend for a bird that never flew so i built him a house on the ground like a few birds i've ever know and he seemed to be so happy there with some friends he knew and his new home and for two years i watched and fed him as with the other birds he played but when they got tired they just flew away then i looked at the loneliness in his eyes and watched the birds fly into the blue but then i look at understandience though he knew why he couldn't do that to and then one summary evening at sunset i saw a perfect picture of love each one of his playmates where beautiful white doves then the ruffle of their feathers as they started into flight but then i noticed all but one dove was fine but he looked like my bird but he had wings solid gold and new but then i knew it was my bird the little bird that never flew until then

TRADITIONAL
Smile from the inside out smile from the inside out
Black Drought makes you smile from the inside out"
420,Blackie Kentucky,Dolly Parton,"In my home town of Blackie, Kentucky
He came passin' through one dark, gloomy day
And I considered myself as lucky
When he told me he would take me away
And though he was older, it made me no difference
His promise of riches was all I could see
At last I could leave the coal mines of Kentucky
And know something better than sad poverty
Blackie, Kentucky, you know that I'll miss you
But there are other places in the world I'd like to see
So I must take this chance to be somethin' more than nothin'
But I'll always hold you in my memory
But I've never adjusted to sociable livin'
The friends that he knows, they're all strangers to me
Thousands of miles from Blackie, Kentucky
In a mansion with a husband that never loved me
He won't let my family and friends come to visit
Because they are country and poor, he's ashamed
Oh, but I'd give my life, Lord, if I could just go see them
All that's changed about me is my name
Blackie, Kentucky, oh Lord, how I miss you
If I could come back home, I'd never leave you anymore
I'd like to see my poor, hardworking, coal-minin' Daddy
And Mama, and the kids, and the friends I knew before
My world is as black as the coal in Kentucky
He won't let me leave him - there's no way to win
I'll take my own life, dear God, please forgive me
But I've got to get back home to Blackie once again
An' I've left him a note, in the mornin' he'll find it
It's my last request and he can't refuse me
I've told him to bury me back in Blackie, Kentucky
Where my family and my friends can come and visit me
Blackie, Kentucky I'm comin' home to you
But different from the way you remember me before
So make me a place and I'll lay me down to rest
And I'll sleep in your arms forevermore
I'll sleep in your arms forever more"
421,Blowin In The Wind,Dolly Parton,"How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
Yes, and how many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Before they're forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till we know
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
It's blowin' in the wind
Blowin', blowin' in the wind
How many years can a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea?
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
Pretending he just doesn't see?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Blowin', blowin' in the wind
Blowin', it's blowin' in the wind
Blowin', it's blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind"
422,Blue Me,Dolly Parton,"Blue me, blue me
Blue is the color
That fits best on me
I'm blue
Just as blue as can be
Blue me, blue me
I cry
And I die
I lie awake at night
And I question why
Must it be
I can never be free
Blue me, blue me
My heart is heavy
But it's empty inside
No one to love me
Or to lay down beside
I'm blue
The queen of sorrow
Wears royal blue
My luck ain't changin'
Is it ever goin' to
I'm blue, oh I'm blue
Why must I wear this robe of blue misery
Blue me, blue me
Ooh
This sad old feeling
Is breakin' me down
No satisfaction with these blues hangin' 'round
Lord, I'm blue
Oh, I'm so blue
Why can't I shake it tell me where will this end
When will I get out of this blue rut I'm in
Oh, I'm blue
Looks like the blues just took a liking to me
Blue me, blue me
Blue me, blue me
Blue is the color that fits best on me
Ooooh, I'm blue
I'm just as blue as can be
Blue me,
Blue me"
423,Blue Smoke,Dolly Parton,"Blue smoke climbin' up the mountain
Blue smoke windin' round the bend
Blue smoke is the name of the heartbreak train
That I am ridin' in
I left a note I wrote I'm leaving
And I won't be coming back
Blue smoke rolling, rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling down the track
Oh, click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee clack
Just stay on track an' never look back
Choo-choo, choo-choo, woo-woo-woo
Blue smoke is comin' through
Oh I know I'm gonna miss you
But I hope it ain't for long
And I wonder if you're even gonna notice that I'm gone
Oh it hurts to know you cheated
And it hurt to know you lied
But it hurts me even worse to know you never even tried
I packed my suitcase full of heartaches
Headin' to the train depot
And I bought a one-way ticket
On that train they call Blue Smoke
Left the station straight-up midnight
Feelin' lonely, lost and blue
In a trail of blue smoke with my heart broke
Said good-bye to you
Blue smoke climbin' up the mountain
Blue smoke windin' round the bend
Blue smoke is the name of the heartbreak train
That I am ridin' in
I left a note I wrote I'm leaving
And I won't be coming back
Blue smoke rolling, rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling down the track
Oh, click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee clack
Just stay on track an' never look back
Choo-choo, choo-choo, woo-woo-woo
Blue smoke is comin' through
Blue smoke climbin' up the mountain
Blue smoke windin' round the bend
Blue smoke is the name of the heartbreak train
That I am ridin' in
I left a note I wrote I'm leaving
And I won't be coming back
Blue smoke rolling, rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling down the track
Blue smoke climbin', blue smoke windin'
And it's rolling, rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling down the track
Blue smoke flyin', I said good-bye and
I'm rolling, rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling down the track
Yeah I'm rolling, rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling down the track"
424,Blue Valley Songbird,Dolly Parton,"She was born in a place called Blue Valley
At the foot of the Tennessee hills
With the blue birds and blue bells
And blue mountain water
And the sound of the Blue Whippoorwill
But there was no peace in the valley
Her daddy, a cruel, ruthless man
Used and abused her mind and her body
So her mama said run while you can
So at fifteen she took to the highway
Belongings and guitar in hand
And she buried herself in her music
The one thing she did understand
And she sings like a bird and she writes like a poet
Her voice has that high, lonesome sound
She hurts, and her songs are the best way to show it
So the Blue Valley songbird keeps traveling around
She hopes someday she will make it
And everyone says that she will
When she comes to town, crowds flock around
To see the girl from the Tennessee hills
She writes her letter back home to her mama
In care of the preacher in town
They're sacred to her so she reads them at church
And so her daddy cannot track her down
And she sings like a bird and she cries like a baby
Whenever she turns off the lights
She's a whole lot lonesome and a little bit crazy
From mem'ries and miseries and dreams gone awry
Blue dress, blue shoes, a blue Cadillac
A band dressed in blue by her side
Instruments tied to the top and the back
'Cause the Blue Valley songbird is singing tonight
One nighters, honky tonks, years flying by
She never made it, but Lord knows she tries
Expressing the feelings she holds inside
And the Blue Valley songbird is singing tonight
Oh the Blue Valley songbird is singing tonight
And she sings like a bird and she writes like a poet"
425,Bluer Pastures,Dolly Parton,"
I was looking for greener pastures
When I left my old Kentucky home
I was chasing after dreams I thought I'd master
So I left the one that loved me all along
Thinking only of myself and doing better
Didn't care about the grief I left behind
Didn't even make a card or write a letter
So sure I'd be successful in no time
Now I'm heading for bluer pastures
And back to the one who's heart I broke
To the bluegrass state of Kentucky
Where he waits with open for me I hope

Isn't it funny how you are when you're younger?
How what you have is never good enough
How the years will find you searching through your plunder
Looking for the treasures you gave up
Well the seasons came, they went
The dreams all shattered
While the grass just stayed a lonely shade of brown
Then I realized I'd lost all that had mattered
So with foolish pride aside, I'm homeward bound

Now I'm heading for bluer pastures
And back to the one who's heart I broke
To the bluegrass state of ole Kentucky
Where he waits with open for me I hope
Now I'm heading for bluer pastures
Where the bluegrass waves sweetly in the wind
Where the bluegrass music's always playing
To the haunting sound of Monroe's mandolin
I'm heading for bluer pastures"
426,Bobbys Arms,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
Bobby's arms, they are warm when he holds me
Bobby's arms always comfort and console me
When I'm in his arms held tight
I know everything's alright
Just as long as I'm inside bobby's arms
Chorus:
Bobby's arms always welcome me inside
Bobby's arms always hold me when I cry
Bobby's arms are my shelter from life's storms
And I feel so safe in Bobby's arms
Bobby's arms, they are strong but they're tender
Bobby's arms reach for me and I surrender
When he reaches out for me, I'm never out of reach
And I always want to be in Bobby's arms
Repeat Chorus"
427,Boulder To Birmingham,Dolly Parton,"I don't wanna hear a love song
I got on this aer'plane just to fly
I know there's life below me
But all that you can show me
Is the prairie and the sky
I don't wanna hear a sad story
Filled with heartbreak and desire
The last time I felt like this
I was in the wilderness
And the canyon was on fire
And I stood on the mountain
In the night and I watched it burn
I watched it burn, God, I watched it burn
I would rock my soul
In the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life
In his saving grace
I would walk all the way
From Boulder to Birmingham
If I thought I could see
Just see your face, oh
Well, you really got me this time, you got me this time
And the hardest part is knowing that I survived
And I've come to listen to the sounds of the trucks
As they moved out on Highway 95
And pretending it's the ocean
Coming down to wash me clear
To wash me clear
If you know what I mean
I would rock my soul
In the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life
In a saving grace
I would walk all the way
From Boulder to Birmingham
If I thought I could see
Just see your face
I would walk all the way
From Boulder to Birmingham
If I thought I could see
Just see your face, ooh, ohh"
428,Brave Little Soldier,Dolly Parton,"I'm a brave little soldier
I must be bold and strong
A brave little soldier
And I must carry on
I'm a brave little soldier
A brave little soldier
I'm a brave little soldier
I must fight, I must win
I'm a brave little soldier
Through hell and back again
I'm a brave little soldier
A brave little soldier
Per rum, pum, pum
Per rum, pum, pum
Per rum, pum, pum, pum, pum
Ye though I am marching through the valley filled with fear
My steps are sure and sturdy and my aim is straight and clear
The enemy is stalking me just waiting for the kill
Like David slewed Galiath
I will claim this battle field
I'm a brave little soldier
I must do what I can
I'm a brave little soldier
And I must take a stand
I'm a brave little soldier
A brave little soldier
Marching, marching onward
Searching out the light of truth
I did not start the war
But it's a battle I can't lose
Faith will be my armor
And love my sword and shield
I must defeat the enemy
I will, I will, I will
A brave little soldier
I must be bold and strong
A brave little soldier
And I must carry on
A brave little soldier
A brave little soldier
I'm a brave little soldier
A brave little soldier
Brave, little soldier"
429,Bridge,Dolly Parton,"The bridge so high the bridge so tall here is where it's started on bridge
The moon is big and yellow and the stars're all aglow
From the bridge I see reflection in the waters far below
You kissed me for the first time here held me awfully tight
And the bridge became our favorite place we came here often in the night
One night while standing on the bridge desire swept through a spoke
Passion took us by the hand and showed us where to go
From the bridge we saw a meadow so we ran together there
Where we found love together hurry motions filled the air
The bridge so wide the bridge so long
Where once we stood together tonight I stand alone
Tonight while standing on the bridge my heart is beating wild
To think that you could leave me here with our unborn child
My feet are moving slowly closer to the edge
Here is where it's started and here is where I'll end it"
430,Bubbling Over,Dolly Parton,"You're the one that puts the sparkle in my eyes
You're the one that puts the laughter in my smile
You're the one that puts the meaning in my life
And I'm bubblin' over, bubblin' over, bubblin' over
Because you are mine
Bubblin' over with the joy that only love can bring
Bubblin' over with the song you taught my heart to sing
And I'm so happy lovin' you that anyone can see
That I'm bubblin' over, bubblin' over, bubblin' over
Because you love me
I have never known a love that felt like this
You're the one I want to share my lovin' with
Your gentle way of lovin' me and your thoughtfulness
Keeps me bubblin' over, bubblin' over, bubblin' over with happiness
Bubblin' over with the joy that only love can bring
Bubblin' over with the song you taught my heart to sing
And I'm so happy lovin' you that anyone could see
That I'm bubblin' over, bubblin' over, bubblin' over
Because you love me
Yes, I'm bubblin' over, I'm bubblin' over, I'm bubblin' over
'Cause you love me"
431,Burning,Dolly Parton,"When I look at you
I melt like a candle
You light a fire in me
What am I to do
I just hope I can handle
The heat and the smoke blinding me
This feeling, this fire
This burning desire
Is raging its way through my soul
And if you feel the same
Help me fan the flames
'til we're burning out of control
Burning to know you
Burning to show you
And I've felt this way from the start
Burning with passion
I do hope it's lasting
And it's burning a hole in my heart
You kindle in me
A warm glowing feeling
A spark and a flicker of hope
It's more than a game
And like moths to a flame
We're drawn to its warmth and its glow
These embers of love
Are fueled by the notion
This could be an eternal flame
Consumed by the blaze
I fear it's too late
'Cause this torch that I hold bears your name
Oh, and I'm burning to know you
Burning to hold you
It's grown to a flame from a spark
Burning with passion
I do hope it's lasting
And it's burning a hole in my heart
Oh, I'm burning with passion
I do hope it's lasting...
I've had so many dreams fall apart...
And it's burning a hole in my heart...
I'm burning
Oh, I'm burning
Mmmm, I'm burning oh, I burning ooh"
432,Burning The Midnight Oil,Dolly Parton,"Here we sit lookin' at each other
Seems we're at a loss for what to say
Ties bind us both with someone else
We don't want to hurt but we must break away
And tonight I'll sit home a thinking
And tonight I'll sit home a drinking
We both live in seperate homes where there's no love at all
Stayin' up late burning the midnight oil

Tomorrow we'll meet here in the same place
Where love and desires just won't wait
In each other's arms we'll dream for a little while
Then when it's time to leave it'll nearly drive us wild
And tonight again I'll sit home a thinking...
Stayin' up late burning the midnight oil"
433,Burning To Burned,Dolly Parton,"You lied to me
I can't believe
That I've been such a fool
I thought this time
I might find
Someone who would play by the rules
My mind said no
But my heart said go
And again I've made the wrong turn
Now here I stand
My heart in your hands...
And I've gone from burning to burned
Ah, you'd think by now
I'd know how
To keep this heart of mine safe
It goes to show
You just never know
Who can you trust these days
How could I make
The same mistake
But as far as I'm concerned
Got myself to blame
Got to close to the flame
Now I've gone from burning to burned
Everyone knows
The old saying goes
That a fool in love
Never learns
But I guess I forgot
'Cause the fire was too hot...
Now I've gone from burning to burned
Oh I guess I forgot
'Cause the fire was too hot...
Now I've gone from burning to burned"
434,Busy Signal,Dolly Parton,"By: Dolly Parton
Busy signal
That's what I get when I call you
Busy busy
Talking to someone new
I wish I knew
I shouldn't worry 'cause it's probably his mother
Or then again it could even be his little brother
On the line
Making me lose my mind
Hang up hang up hang up hang up
Come on hang up hang up hang up
Gotta talk to my baby
Gotta tell him I'm sorry
Busy signal
How can I tell him I'm sorry
When I said I didn't care
I didn't mean a word I said
Talking outta my head
I've got to reach him now and tell him that I love him
And from now on I'll stay right by his side and love him
All the time
So please somebody quit tying up the line
Hang up hang up hang up hang up
Come on hang up hang up hang up
Gotta talk to my baby
Gotta tell him I'm sorry
I didn't mean to hurt you baby
I really really love you baby"
435,But You Loved Me Then,Dolly Parton,"Remember all the castles that we once built in the sand
Remember how we used to go and visit fairy land
Remember how we'd search for that pot of gold at the rainbow's end
But you loved me then
And the flowers the we picked from the fields where we did run
And the sunbeams that we'd catch from the summer's golden sun
And the butterflies we'd chase as we'd go running through the wind
But you loved me then
Now I walk through the ruins of our castles in the sand
When you left I lost my way forever and the fairy land
Now the rainbows have all gone and the flowers have all died
And the sunbeams that we caught have all gone free again
And the butterfiles we chased have all gone with the wind
And you no longer care but you love me then
(And you no longer care) but you love me then
(And you no longer care) but you love me then"
436,Butterflies,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
I would spin for you a blanket
Out of gold and silver threads
I would let my gentle bosom
Be a pillow for your head
I'd caress your perfect body
On a rosy bed at night
Play you love songs on a golden harp
And sing you Butterflies
In a diamond-studded chalice
On an emerald-plated tray
I would bring to you sweet nectar
And gifts of bright array
I would paint for you a castle
In a blue and yellow sky
Paint you happy ever after
And paint you Butterflies
Butterflies, my heart flutters with the notion
I get high on the wings of sweet emotion
Darling I, I just think of you and I get butterflies
I get close to you and I get butterflies

If only I were magic
I would make the wishes true
I would wave a magic wand
And be in Paradise with you
But I'm just a girl that loves you
I will love you all my life
But I do have a magic feeling
And it gives me butterflies
Butterflies, my heart flutters with the notion
I get high on the wings of sweet emotion
Darling I, I just think of you and I get butterflies
We should fly away together, you and I
Off to paradise forever, I get high
I get close to you and I get butterflies
I think of you and I get butterflies
I will spin for you a blanket out of gold and silver threads
If only I were magic, I would make the wishes true
I would wave a magic wand and be in paradise with you"
437,Calm On The Water,Dolly Parton,"In a dream I was walkin' in a beautiful field
I was gathering flowers at the foot of a hill
When a bright light descended and it spread o'er the land
Jesus stood on the mountain and He held out His hand
Then He came down from the mountain, headed down to the sea
And the children strowed flowers in the path at His feet
And He was filled with compassion and the beasts from the wild
Came as gentle as lambs and they all walked at His side
There's a calm on the water, a hush in the crowd
There's peace in the valley, there's a stillness about
There's a light in the darkness, there's joy in His love
Ain't that a wonderful feelin', let us lift Him up
Then He suddenly vanished from the crowd down below
Reappeared on the mountain in a radiant glow
He said your questions are many but the answer is love
I'll draw all men unto me if I be lifted up
There's a calm on the water, a hush in the crowd
There's peace in the valley, there's a stillness about
There's a light in the darkness, there's joy in His love
There is life everlasting, let us lift Him up
He said if I (He said if I)
Be lifted up (be lifted up)
He said if I be lifted up, what did he say
He said if I (He said if I)
Be lifted up (Be lifted up)
He said if I be lifted up
Let's lift Him higher (higher) and higher (higher)
And higher and higher each day
Let's lift Him up
He said if I (He said if I)
Be lifted up (be lifted up)
Oh if I be lifted up
There's a calm on the water, a hush in the crowd
There's peace in the valley, there's a stillness about
There's a light in the darkness, and joy in His love
It's a wonderful feelin', lift Him up
He said if I (He said if I)
Be lifted up (be lifted up)
He said if I be lifted up, that's what he said
He said if I (He said if I)
Be lifted up (be lifted up)
If I be lifted up
Fade:
He said if I (He said if I)
Be lifted up (be lifted up)"
438,Cant Be That Wrong,Dolly Parton,"So often in my dreams
I hold you close against my skin
Waking up I wish that I could
Sleep and dream again
Cause only when I sleep
Can I not hear how it's a sin
How cheaters never win
Their heartaches never end
""Torn Between Two Lovers"" on the jukebox
And I'm thinking how I could've wrote that song
Wonderin' if God loves us, when we're cheatin'
But why he lets us feels things if it's wrong
I guess I should be singing ""Rock of Ages""
""Amazing Grace"", some of those good songs
Can't find it in my heart to ask forgiveness
Anything that feels this right can't be that wrong
Thou shalt not commit it
It's written in the tin
The spirit is always willing
But the flesh is weak again
And you're as close to heaven
As I might ever fly
An angel in disguise
A wrong that feels so right
And Torn Between Two Lovers just keeps playing
And I don't wanna be right if lovin' you is wrong
It goes against all I've ever stood for
Knowin' I have someone else at home
I guess I should be singing ""Rock of Ages""
""Amazing Grace"", some of those good songs
But my cheatin' heart can tell on me tomorrow
Cause anything that feels this right can't be that wrong
To hell with heaven if it means I'll lose you
Anything that feels this right can't be that wrong
It just can't be"

440,Cash On The Barrelhead,Dolly Parton,"I got in a little trouble at the county seat
Lord, they put me in the jailhouse
For loafing on the street
Well, the judge said guilty
He made his point
He said fourty-five dollars
Or thirty days in the joint
That'll be cash on the barrelhead, hun
You can take your choice
You're twenty-one
No money down
No credit plan
No time to chase you
Cause I'm a busy man
I found a telephone number on a laundry slip
I had a good, hardy jailor
With a six gun hip
He let me call long distance
She said, ""Number, please""
And just as soon as I told her
She shouted back at me
Said that'll be cash on the barrelhead, hun
Not part, not half
But the entire sum
No money down
No credit line
Cause a little boy tells me
You're the travelin' kind
Thirty days in the jailhouse
Four days on the road
I was feelin' mighty hungry
My feet, a heavy load
I saw a Greyhound comin'
Stuck out my thumb
As soon as I was seated
The driver caught my arm
Said that'll be cash on the barrelhead, hun
This old, grey dog gets paid to run
When the engine starts
And the wheels will roll
Give me cash on the barrelhead
I take ya down the road
Ohh, cash on the barrelhead
I take you down the road"
441,Change,Dolly Parton,"Someday when I'm over you
And when I think I'm able to
Well, I might try to be
Your friend again
But your restless heart
And rovin' eyes
My jealousy, these
endless fights
I've got to get out of your life
Or I will never mend
Chorus:
I guess I'll die a bit each day
But I'm always dying anyway
And I don't have the heart to
Stay, and I can't take the pain
I know we've tried to no avail
Our heaven now has
Turned to hell
The same old hurt
We know so well
And something's got
To change
We both know it's got to end
The passion's gone
It's just pretend
And one of us have got
To make the move
We might as well just give it up
We've lost respect and
There's no trust
And without this, there's
No real love
It's just some sad excuse
2nd Chorus:
I guess I'll die a bit each day
But I'm always dying anyway
And there's nothing left but walk away
Ain't this a crying shame
A change of pace
A change of heart
A change of place
A place to start
And we'll be better off apart
Our only chance is change
Tag:
And we never will
But something has to change
Fade:
But someday when I'm over you
And when I think I'm able to
Then I will try to be your friend again
But I don't want to see
Your face 'til then
Change, I need a change
I need a change
We need a change"
442,Chicken Every Sunday,Dolly Parton,"Just because all my dresses are just cotton hand-me-downs
This family calls me the lower class
Cause we're only poor folks on the other side of town
They won't let him walk up my path
But my mama says don't worry when they say those things about ye
You remember you're just as good as him
Just because they got that big house settin' way upon the hill
Why you don't have to look up to them
We've got chicken every Sunday and the preacher comes around
And every Saturday morning daddy takes us all to town
And we'd go to the picture show or picnics on the ground
Oh that's the lower class and I'm glad that's what I am

Cause my mama don't belong to the ladies social set
My daddy can't afford the country club
His folks look down on me and they don't let us date
Cause they think that I'm not good enough
But my mama says forgive him honey he ain't worthy of
And in anything you're too good for him
Just because they've got money and a big fine house
Well we won't take no self off of them
We've got chicken every Sunday...
We've got chicken every Sunday..."
443,Christmas Without You,Dolly Parton,"Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
Like fireworks with no fuse
Christmas without you
The fireplace keeps burning
And my thoughts keep turning
The pages of memories
Of time spent with you
Old Christmas songs we knew
And used to make love too
Make it hard to get used to
Christmas without you
Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
I love you, I miss you
So sad but so true
Christmas without you
Like a mystery with no clues
Like fireworks with no fuse
Christmas without you
The sweetest gift I know
Would be if the new snow
Could fall on your footsteps
On this Christmas Eve
The most joyous Christmas
If luck could be with us
Would be if Saint Nicholas
Brought you home to me
Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
I love you, I miss you, I need you
So sad but so true
Christmas without you
Like a mystery with no clues
Like fireworks with no fuse
Christmas without you
Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
I love you, I miss you
So sad but so true
Christmas without you
I just can't get used to
I just have no use
Of Christmas without you
You know that I want you
You know that I need you
You know that I need you
You know that I want you
You know that I want you, I need you, I love you
Honest I do
You know that I want you
You know that I need you
You know that I need you
You know that I want you
And I love you, I want you, I need you
I do"
444,Closer By The Hour,Dolly Parton,"You're the sweetest one I know and I just can't let you go
I just dream of holding you inside my arms
I go home each night to stay but I just can't stay away
And we get closer closer by the hour
We get closer by the hour though we've tried with all our power
To stay away from each other's arms
We get closer by the hour like the bee goes to the flower
Closer closer by the hour
We come closer with each kiss and I feel your lips insist
But I do your will and love you more and more
Although we know it's wrong we can't stay where we belong
And we get closer closer by the hour
We get closer by the hour..."
445,Coat Of Many Colors,Dolly Parton,"Back through the years I go wanderin' once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my momma put the rags to use
There were rags of many colors
But every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat
And it was way down in the fall
Momma sewed the rags together
Sewin' every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors
That I was so proud of
As she sewed, she told a story
From The Bible, she had read
About a coat of many colors
Joseph wore and then she said
""Perhaps this coat will bring you
Good luck and happiness""
And I just couldn't wait to wear it
And momma blessed it with a kiss
My coat of many colors
That my momma made for me
Made only from rags
But I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money
Oh, I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors
My momma made for me
So with patches on my britches
And holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors
I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing
And making fun of me
And my coat of many colors
My momma made for me
And oh I couldn't understand it
For I felt I was rich
And I told them of the love
My momma sewed in every stitch
And I told 'em all the story
Momma told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colors
Was worth more than all their clothes
But they didn't understand it
And I tried to make them see
That one is only poor
Only if they choose to be
Now I know we had no money
But I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors
My momma made for me
Made just for me"
446,Cologne,Dolly Parton,"You ask me not to wear cologne, 
She'll know you've been with me alone.
And you can't take our secret home
So you ask me not to wear cologne.
You can wipe the makeup off, 
The lipstick or a little gloss; 
But fragrance lingers on
And on so you ask me not to wear cologne.
You leave my bed and go to hers leaving me alone and hurt.
I love you whether right or wrong
And you ask me not to wear cologne.
I'm not out to hurt someone, 
Not you, not her, not anyone.
But I've got heartaches of my own, why, 
I can't even wear cologne. Oh, 
But I never meant for this to be, 
It wasn't in my heart to cheat.
Love has a nature all it's own
So I willingly gave up cologne.
Oh, and every time you come to me, 
I realize I'm in too deep.
I know you love us both
And I keep holdin' on you ask me not to wear cologne; 
You say don't wear cologne.
Oh, whatever am I gonna do 'cause I am so in love with you.
I know you love us both, but where do I belong?
You ask me not to wear cologne?
You ask me not to wear cologne, 
She'll know you've been with me alone.
And you can't take our secret home
So you ask me not to wear cologne.
Oh, how do I walk away from the greatest love I've known?
You ask me not to wear cologne.
Oh, you ask me not to wear cologne.
You ask me not to wear cologne.
She'll know you've been with me alone
And I'm a scent you can't take home.
But will I ever get to wear cologne?"
447,Come Back To Me,Dolly Parton,"Come back to me
Come back and say you're still in love with me
Come back and say that I am all you'll ever need
Baby come back come back to me
Oh please come back to me
Come back and say you'll work it out with me
Come back to stay and say you're never gonna leave
Baby come back, come back to me
Oh and kiss me once again as only you can
Touch me like nobody else can do

448,Come To Me,Dolly Parton,"Everyone needs someone they feel that they can run to
Let me be your someone the one you always come to
I wish you only happiness but that won't always be
So come to me when you're in need won't you come to me
Come to me when you're down I will help you up
When you find you need the strenght that only comes from love
Let me be the one you run to in your time of need
Come to me when you're in need come to me
Come to me when you're in need and let me hide you from the world outside
Come to me when you're in need and I will dry your teardrops when you cry
Come to me let me be the one that gives you strenght when you are weak
Come to me when you're in need come to me
Come to me when you're in need come to me
Won't you come to me"
449,Comes And Goes,Dolly Parton,"(Porter Wagoner)
Now and then, here and there, I still see you 
And sometimes my memory lets me hear your voice, so soft and low 
But like the wind you travel in, you seem to come and go 
At times, my mind is crystal clear 
And then I think of you 
Then the spin of the room I'm in 
Brings you into view 
Love that once 
Held my mind completely in control 
Now makes it spin like tornado wind 
As it comes and goes 
Well, look who's here 
I told myself that you'd be coming soon 
I hope that you can stay for a little while 
It's so lonesome in this room 
And you look just the same today 
Do you still love me so? 
What's that you say, you can't stay? 
You seem to come and go 
At times my mind is crystal clear 
And then I think of you 
Then the spin of the room I'm in 
Brings you into view 
Love that once 
Held my mind completely in control 
Now makes it spin like tornado winds 
As it comes and goes"
450,Control Yourself,Dolly Parton,"Chorus:
Control yourself, control yourself
If you wanna make him care for you, oh
Control yourself, control yourself
Though its gettin' mighty hard to do
I let him tell me all those lies
And then I look into his eyes
And then it begins, I go in a spin
He's the boy that I dreamed about
And now that we are going out, girl you'd better
Repeat Chorus
And when he's holding me so near
He whispers sweet things in my ear
And then it begins, all over again
I just want him to hold me tight
Tell me that everything's alright, girl you'd better
Repeat Chorus
Yeah, its gettin' mighty hard to do
Getting mighty, mighty hard to do
Yeah, its gettin' mighty hard to do
Oh its gettin' mighty hard to do"
451,Could I Have Your Autograph,Dolly Parton,"Hello, I don't know me from Adam, you don't know me from Eve
I just came here tonight 'cause I was lonely
You're no Elvis Presley, I'm no Marilyn Monroe
But I do think you're sexy, just thought I'd tell you so
Hey could I have your autograph
Your name and your number on a small photograph
I'd like to know you and what you're all about
Hey could I have your autograph
I've had my eyes on you and you're worth lookin' at
Could I ask you out or should a lady do that
You may not be famous but you look like a star
You should be in movies as cute as you are
Hey could I have your autograph
Your name and your number on a small photograph
Could I interest you in a romance perhaps
Hey could I have your autograph
Got my heart in my hands and my head in the clouds
And you're everything every girl dreams about
And being with you would be heaven no doubt
What I wouldn't do for your autograph
Oh could I have your autograph
Oh could I have your autograph
Hey could I have your autograph
I like your body could I help you work it out
Maybe moving to the music playing on the phonograph
Hey could I have your autograph
Oh could I have your autograph
You know you're just the kind to makes a woman real proud
Would you take a chance on a girl from the South
Could I have your autograph"
452,Country Is As Country Does,Dolly Parton,"I can live in a mansion or a double-wide
Eat sushi raw or my catfish fried
Wherever I am, then that's where I belong
'Cause I'm quite content with who I am
And if you ain't, well, kiss my ham
Country is as country does and I'm country to the bone
Country is as country does
It's the way I am and it's the way I was
It's the way I always will be, that's for sure
Country born and country bred
Countryfied and country-fed
A country heart and a country head
'Cause I'm country to the core
Now, I can drive a tractor or a Cadillac
I can fly first class or slum in the back
But I'll be the same ol' gal when I arrive
I can wear denim or I can wear silk
Drink champagne or chocolate milk
Take the best or live with less, 'cause a country girl survives
Country is as country does
It's the way I am and it's the way I was
And the way I'll be until they lay me low
Country born and country bred
I'm countryfied and I'm country-fed
And I'll be that way 'til I'm country dead
'Cause I'm country head to toe
And what you see is what you get
Nothing's ever changed me yet
Nothing will, it's a pretty safe bet
'Cause I'm country through and through
Oh, that's country!
Country is as country does
It's the way I am and it's the way I was
It's the way I'll be until my dying day
I'm country born and country bred
Countryfied and country-fed
And nothing done and nothing said can change my country ways
Nothing done and nothing said
Nothing's gonna change my country ways
I don't think so
Wouldn't change if I could
Country is as country does
It's the way I is and it's the way I was
Country born and country bred
I'm countryfied and I'm country-fed, you know that
But now that don't mean I can't go to town!"
453,Country Road,Dolly Parton,"Saw you turnin' down main street in your big, black fancy car
You were dressed up fit to kill, with a pretty girl on your arm
You spun around and you headed up town
Where the neon lights all shine
Left me choking in a cloud of dust
You never pay me no mind
Chorus:
You're livin' in the fast lane
I guess I'm just too slow
I never wore silk or fancy furs
Just plain ole calico
I'll never be a fast lane lover
And they're the only kind you take up town
I am just a country road
That you keep turnin' down
If you ever hit a dead end street
If it's love that you're looking for
You can always turn around
And beat a path right to my door
Do I have to draw you a map
You seem to know your way around
So when you're tired of spinnin' your wheels
Baby, we can go to town
Repeat Chorus
I'll never be a fast lane lover
And they're the only kind you take up town
I am just a country road
That you keep turnin' down
I am just a country road
That you keep turnin' down
Repeat Chorus"
454,Cowgirl The Dandy,Dolly Parton,"In the airport lounge, he sat with his cane and durby hat
The grandest man that i had ever seen
Outside the heavy rains had grounded all the planes
So i asked him if he'd like some company
In my rhinestone-studded suit
And my cowgirl high-heel boots
I must have been a site for him to see
But he said, ""pull up a chair""
As i fumble with my hair
A more unlikely pair you'll never see
I was mogan david wine
He was chablis fifty-nine
But there we sat
The cowgirl and the dandy
He was ski resorts in aspen
And summers in paris
I was grand ole opry nashville, tennessee
The cowgirl and the dandy
As different as can be
But it seemed so right that rainy night in tennessee
Then somewhere in between
His harvey's bristol cream
And the beer that i kept sippin' at his table
We somehow came together for a night of stormy wheater
Now there's a little bit of class in this old cabin
An' there's a little country in the dandy
Repeat I was mogan david wine
He was chablis fifty-nine
But there we sat
The cowgirl and the dandy
He was ski resorts in aspen
And summers in paris
I was grand ole opry nashville, tennessee
He was ski resorts in aspen
And summers in paris
I was grand ole opry nashville, tennessee"
455,Crimson And Clover,Dolly Parton,"Now I don't hardly know her
But I think I could love her

Over and over
Yeah
My mind's such a sweet thing
I wanna do everything
What a beautiful feeling
Crimson and clover
Over and over

Crimson and clover, over and over

456,Crippled Bird,Dolly Parton,"A broken heart like a broken wing
It must have its time to mend
I am like a crippled bird
In hopes one day to fly again
I loved you so and I was faithful
I cared more than words could say
But love is cruel and life is hateful
Now you've gone and flown away
Chorus:
Oh, to die, 'Twould be a pleasure
Slow to heal, but quick to cry
Fragile as a sparrow's feather
Crippled bird too blue to fly
Oh, the loss is cold and shameful
And the grief so deep and sharp
There is nothing quite as painful
As a true blue broken heart
Repeat Chorus
Fragile as a sparrow's feather
Crippled bird too blue to fly"
457,Cross My Heart,Dolly Parton,"I know there's times when you must wonder
If my love is true, and I'm satisfied
I wish I knew a way to show you
I'm forever yours for the rest of my life
Chorus:
I cross my heart and hope to die
I'll always be here by your side
My love grows stronger as the time goes by
Cross my heart and hope to die
And all those times we're not together
You're in my heart and you're on my mind
You're like a part of me that's missing
I cross my heart and hope to die
Chorus:
I cross my heart and hope to die
I'll always be here by your side
My love grows stronger as the time goes by
Cross my heart and hope to die
Repeat Chorus
Tag:
I cross my heart and hope to die
I cross my heart"
458,Cry Cry Darlin,Dolly Parton,"Cry, cry darlin', that's what I'll do
If you should leave me with the blues
Cry, cry darlin', that's what I'll do
If you're the one that I should lose
For me there will be no moonlight
If ever we should part
Cry, cry darlin', that's all I'll do
'Cause you're the one that's in my heart
Cry, cry darlin', my eyes would cry
And never dry if you should go
Cry, cry darlin', when shadows creep
I'll just weep all night I know
You know how much I'd miss you
If ever we should part
Cry, cry darlin', that's all I'll do
'Cause you're the one that's in my heart
Oh, cry, cry darlin', that's all I'll do
'Cause you're the one that's in my heart"
459,Curse Of The Wild Weed Flower,Dolly Parton,"Their thoughts're all mingled their dreams all confused
Their minds and their bodies how they abuse
Searching for answers that doesn't grow there
Bound by the curse of the wild weed flower
Their plans their desires and all of their hopes
Wither and die as they go up in smoke
Sharp as a needle and filled with despair
Such is the curse of the wild weed flower
From a moment of joy to a lifetime of sorrow
For one day of pleasure they trade their tomorrows
Lost in a garden where bulbs all grow
With blossoms of heartaches and petals of woe
Eyes full of emptiness just stand and stare
Bound by the curse of the wild weed flower
Bound by the curse of the wild weed flower
Bound by the curse of the wild weed flower"
460,Divorce,Dolly Parton,"Our little boy is four years old and quite a little man
So we spell out the words we don't want him to understand
Like T-O-Y or maybe S-U-R-P-R-I-S-E
But the words we're hiding from him now
Tear the heart right out of me
Our D-I-V-O-R-C-E becomes final today
Me and little J-O-E will be goin' away
I love you both and this will be pure H-E double L for me
Oh, I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-R-C-E
Watch him smile, he thinks it's Christmas
Or his 5th Birthday and he thinks C-U-S-T-O-D-Y spells fun or play
I spell out all the hurtin' words and turn my head when I speak
'Cause I can't spell away this hurt that's drippin' down my cheek
Our D-I-V-O-R-C-E becomes final today
Me and little J-O-E will be goin' away
I love you both and this will be pure H-E double L for me
Oh, I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-R-C-E"
461,Daddy,Dolly Parton,"Daddy I feel that I must talk to you
Are you sure this is what you want to do?
Now it's not for us kids that I beg you to stay
Please don't just walk out on Mama this way
She's mothered your children, she's spent her whole life
Trying to be a good mother and wife
And she stood by you when the rest let you down
Daddy, how can you walk out on her now?
I'm your oldest daughter, my age twenty-three
Your new love is even younger than me
She's young, she's pretty, her hands soft as dew
While Mama's are withered from working for you
Mom's not young any more like your new love
But your new love won't love you like my mama does
You've taken her best years, so don't leave her now
Please, Daddy say that you won't let her down"
462,Daddy Come And Get Me,Dolly Parton,"In this mental institution, lookin' out through these iron bars
How could he put me in here, how could he go that far
Yes I need help but not this kind, he didn't love me from the start
But it's not my mind that's broken, it's my heart
Oh Daddy come and get me and take me home with you
I'm depending on you Daddy, there's nothing I can do
And you said that I could come to you if I ever was in need
But Daddy I can't come to you, you'll have to come to me
When he said he loved another, I was crazy with jealousy
That's 'cause I was crazy over him and I couldn't stand to set him free
And I couldn't stand to lose him and I cried and cried for days
And he said that I was crazy but he just put me in here to get me out of his way
Daddy come and get me
Oh Daddy come and get me and take me home with you
I'm depending on you Daddy 'cause there's nothing else I can do
And you said that I could come to you if I ever was in need
But Daddy I can't come to you, you'll have to come to me
Oh Daddy, come and get me"

465,Daddy Wont Be Home Anymore,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
As I look around the little house we were so happy in
I think of all the happy times we'll never see again
Then I break down and start to cry, the children ask what for
I can't find a way to tell them that Daddy won't be home anymore
Each night before they go to sleep they fold their little hands
And say a prayer for Daddy fighting in their far-off land
So tonight I'll help them say their prayers like I've always done before

God give me courage to tell them that Daddy won't be home anymore
But honey as for me there'll never be another man
And I'll bring our children up the best way that I can
You died for what you thought was right that much I know for sure
But the children just can't understand why Daddy won't be home anymore
No the children just don't understand why Daddy won't be home anymore"
466,Daddys Moonshine Still,Dolly Parton,"Folks say my daddy wasn't much of a man
For disobeying the laws of the land
Folks say that my daddy wasn't fit to kill
Oh and I know it was true what the people said
Cause we'd all've been better of dead
Than to live a life of shame and strife
Cause of daddy's moonshine still
My mama was always sweet and kind
But she grew old before her time
Worryin' about the way we had to live
Yeah my daddy put the wrinkles in my mama's face
He drunk his share of all he made
And just one more reason I grew to hate
My daddy's moonshine still
Chorus:
Daddy's moonshine still was good for nothin'
But to break mama's heart
And to tear our home apart
Make our lives a livin' hell
Them old mason jars that daddy made us wash
And set them out to sun on our back porch
'Til he got ready to take 'em up on the hill
And when daddy got word of the revenue
He made us kids help hide his brew
Made us swear that we never knew
About daddy's moonshine still
Yeah and two of my brothers drove across the state line
Once a week with a load of moonshine
And the wounds that came from that won't ever heal
Cause on a moonshine run one rainy night
My two brothers lost their lives
And oh my god how I despise
My daddy's moonshine still
Repeat Chorus
Well it broke mama's heart but she understood
The day that I left home for good
But I had to find me another way to live
Well I sent mama money nearly every day
And how I made it, well I'd rather not say
But at least it took me far away
From daddy's moonshine still
My bootlegging daddy was known quite well
And he made our home a livin' hell
And I ain't forgot it and I know that I never will
My mama finally died she just gave up
And daddy finally died from drinkin' that stuff
And bad memories haunt the rest of us
From daddy's moonshine still
Repeat Chorus"
467,Daddys Working Boots,Dolly Parton,"My dear hard workin' daddy works his life away for us
That's the way that daddy shows to us his love
And Daddy's two hard working hands
They're callous and they're sore
And Daddy's workin' boots have walked a million miles or more
As long as I remember, I remember Daddy workin'
Workin' on the job or either on the farm
Tryin' to provide for the family that he loves
And Daddy's working boots have taken many steps for us
Chorus:
Daddy's workin' boots have served as his foundation
Though just like him, they're tired and worn
For years they've helped him stand
Daddy's working boots have filled their obligation
They've walked that rocky road with a mighty, mighty man
Dear lord above, I know up there my Daddy's got a mansion
And a great reward that's long been overdue
And when it comes my Daddy's time to be with you in heaven
Spoken:
Won't cha let him walk your golden streets
In a pair of brand new golden boots

Daddy's workin' boots"

Oh, you're out there tonight with another
And my pain is so dreadfully sharp
I picture you with her and shudder
It's like a dagger through the heart
Do you think that my feelings don't matter
Or your cheating or hurtful remarks
When you leave me all broken and shattered
It's like a dagger through the heart

Oh, I know I'm a fool to keep staying
When you've made hurting me such an art
Tossed around like a used box of crayons
It's like a dagger through the heart

Oh, you cut me to pieces so often
Like a knife or a poisonous dart
I would be better off in my coffin
It's like a dagger through the heart


Like a dagger through the heart, through the heart"
469,Dark As A Dungeon,Dolly Parton,"Come and listen you fellows
So young and do fine
And seek not your fortune
In the dark, dreary mines
It will form as a habit
Seep in your soul
'Til the blood in your veins
Runs as black as the coal
There's many a man
That I've known in my day
Who lived just to labor
His whole life away
Like a fiend with his dope
And a drunkard his wine
A man will have lust for
The lure of the mine
It's dark as a dungeon
Damp as the dew
The danger is double
And the pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls
Where the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon
Way down in the mine
I hope when I'm gone
And the ages shall roll
My body will blacken
And turn into coal
Then I'll look out the door
Of my heavenly home
And I'll pity the miners
A-diggin' my bones
It's dark as a dungeon
Damp as the dew
The danger is double
And the pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls
Where the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon
Way down in the mine
Where the rain never falls
Where the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon
Way down in the mine"
470,Dark End Of The Street,Dolly Parton,"At the dark end of the street
That's where we always meet
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong
Living in darkness to hide our wrong
You and me at the dark end of the street you and me
I know that time's gonna take its toll
We have to pay for the love we stole
It's a sin and we know it's wrong
Oh but our love keeps a coming on strong
Steal away to the dark end of the street you and me
They're gonna find us yes they're gonna find us
They're gonna find us oh some day
You and me at the dark end of the street you and me
And when the daylight hours roll around
And by ten we're both downtown
If we shoud meet you just walk right on by
Oh my darling now please don't you cry
Tonight we'll meet at the dark end of the street you and me"
471,Deportee,Dolly Parton,"The crops are all in and the peaches are rotting
The oranges are piled in their creosote dumps
You're flying them back to the mexican border
To pay all their money to wade back again
Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita
Adios mis a-mi-gos, Jesus and Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
All they will call you will be deportee
Some of us are illegal and some of us are not wanted
Our work contract's out and we have to move on
But it's 600 miles to that mexican border
They chase us like outlaws, like rustlers, like theives
Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita
Adios mis a-mi-gos, Jesus and Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane

All they will call you will be deportee
My father's own father, waded that river
They took all the money he made in his life
My brothers and sister come work the fruit trees
They rode the truck til' they took down and died
The airplane caught fire over Los Gatos canyon
A fireball of lightning that shook all our hills
Who are these dear friends all scattered like dry leaves
The radio said they were just deportees
Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita
Adios mis a-mi-gos, Jesus and Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
All they will call you will be deportee

473,Detroit City,Dolly Parton,"You know last night I went to sleep in Detroit city
And I dreamed about those cotton fields and home
I dreamed about my mother, dear old papa, sisters and brothers
And I dreamed about a love who's been waiting there so long
I want to go home
I want to go home
Oh how I want to go home
My kinfolks think I'm big in Detraoit city
From all the letters that I write, they think I'm fine
By day I make the cars
But, by night I make all the bars
Oh if only they's just read between the lines
They'd know I want to go home
I want to go home
Oh how I want to go home
You know I rode a freight train north to Detroit city
And after all these years I find I've been wasting my time
Think I'll put my foolish pride on a southbound train and ride
Heading back to the loved ones I left there waiting behind
Repeat Chorus"
474,Dirty Job,Dolly Parton,"It's a dirty job
But somebody's got to do it
Better get to it
Somebody's gotta do it
Whatever it takes, whatever it takes
Any work at all
Is better than none
Better buckle down to it
Gotta get the job done
Gotta earn my pay... I gotta earn my pay
I can't wait around on the lottery
And there ain't no millionaires
Lookin' for me
And somebody's gotta do it, do it
Somebody's gotta do it, do it
Somebody's gotta do it, do it
Somebody
I can think of better things
I'd rather do
I might get lucky
And I'm hopin' to
But until I do
I gotta compromise
The job ain't much
But at least it's mine
It beats standin'
In the unemployment line
Put pride aside
And I'll improvise
Even if I do get a better job
Somebody else
Has gotta fill my spot
Somebody's gotta do it, do it
Somebody's gotta do it, do it
Somebody's gotta do it, do it
Somebody
Somebody
Somebody's gotta do it, do it
Somebody's gotta do it, do it
It's a dirty job
It's a low-down dirty job
Somebody
Even if the rules are too hard to follow
Even when pride is too hard to swallow
It's another day so it's another dollar
That's what it's all about, Oh
It's a dirty job
But somebody's got to do it
Better get to it
Somebody's gotta do it
Whatever it takes
Gotta keep the faith
Any work at all
Is better than none
Better buckle down to it
Gotta get the job done
Gotta earn my way
And it's a workin' day
The job ain't much

475,Do I Ever Cross Your Mind,Dolly Parton,"Sometimes I go walkin' through the fields
Where we walked
long ago in the sweet used-to-be
and the flowers still grow
but they don't smell as sweet
as they did when you picked them for me
and when I think of you
and the love we once knew
how I wish we could go back in time
do you ever think back on old mem'ries like that
or do I cross your mind
Do you ever wake up lonely
In the middle of the night
Because you miss me, do you darlin'
Oh and do your mem'ries ever take you back
Into another place in time
And do you ever miss the feelings and the love
we shared when you were with me, do you darlin'
I just wonder do I cross your mind
Oh how often I wish that again I could kiss
Your sweet lips like I did long ago
How often I long for those two lovin' arms
That once held me so gentle and close
And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever recall these old mem'ries at all
Or do I ever cross your mind
Do you ever wake up lonely
In the middle of the night
Because you miss me, do you darlin'
Oh and do your mem'ries ever take you back
Into another place in time
And do you ever miss the feelings and the love
we shared when you were with me, do you darlin'
I just wonder do I cross your mind
Oh, do I ever cross your mind"
476,Do You Hear The Robins Sing,Dolly Parton,"Where you live you say the view is so beautiful
And the astroturf that's on your lawn stays green the whole year around
And the buildings are so tall they almost reach heaven
But do you ever ever hear the robins sing
Do you hear the robins singing in the springtime
While a mockingbird sings his happy song
Is all the beauty in your world this artificial thing
Do you ever ever hear the robins sing
Where I live the butterflies still kiss the roses
And forgetmenots still grow along the shady lane
And the weeping willow trees still swaying in the breeze
And often I still hear the robins sing
Do you hear the robins...
Do you ever ever hear the robins sing"
477,Dont Call It Love,Dolly Parton,"Nobody believes that I really care for you
They don't think my heart is true
I don't think you agree
You know I'm a lifetime gaurantee
So if they ask you what you mean to me
Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'cause that ain't enough
Just tell 'em you're my everything
Go on and tell 'em baby
Nobody believes we got somethin' they ain't got
They've never seen a fire this hot
They never got that far
We're burning as bright as any star
So if they ask you what your feelings are
Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We've got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'cause that ain't enough
Just tell 'em you're my everything
Go ahead and tell 'em baby
Feels so good, holding tight
Loving you through the night
Oh and they can call it what they like
But they ain't got it right
No, no, no
Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We've got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'cause that ain't enough
Just tell them you're my everything
Oooo...
Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'cause that ain't enough
Just tell 'em you're my everything
Oh, oh, oh
Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'cause that ain't enough"
478,Dont Let It Trouble Your Mind,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
Our love affair is bitter sweet
Insecure and incomplete
And I've often wondered why your leaving's been so long delayed
It's all become so complicated
Maybe you feel obligated
And out of simpathy for me you stay
But I had rather live alone
Than live with someone who doesn't love me
And I'd rather have you go than stay
And put me down a thinkin' you're above me
Our love affair is so wound up
It's best that we unwind
And if you don't love me, leave me
And don't let it trouble your mind
You've waited much too long to leave afraid of how I'd take it
And I'm deeply touched by your concern but I think I can make it
It won't be easy for a while but I'll forget in time
And if you don't love me, leave me and don't let it trouble your mind
I had rather live alone
Than live with someone who doesn't love me
And I'd rather have you go than stay
And put me down a-thinkin' you're above me
Our love affair is so wound up
It's best that we unwind
And if you don't love me, leave me
And don't let it trouble your mind"
479,Dont Let Me Cross Over,Dolly Parton,"I'm tempted my darlin' to steal you away
Don't let me cross over, stay out of my way
'Cause you know that I love you and I'm not the stealin' kind
But I'm faced with heartache here at love's cheating line
Chorus:
Don't let me cross over love's cheating line
You belong to another and can never be mine
I know one step closer would be heaven divine
Don't let me cross over love's cheating line
I've tried to forget you but what else can I do
When your eyes keep saying that you want me too
And I know if I lose you not a dream will I have left
I don't want to cheat dear, but I can't help myself
Repeat Chorus
Tag:
Don't let me cross over love's cheating line"
480,Dont Think Twice,Dolly Parton,"Ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter anyhow
Ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now
When your roof's too close at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You are the reason I'm traveling home
Don't think twice, it's alright
Ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
That night, I never know
Ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talking anyway
Don't think twice, it's alright
But there ain't no use in calling out my name, babe
Like you never did before
And there ain't no use in calling out my name
Cause I can't hear you anymore
Well, I'm thinking and wondering while I'm way down on the road
I once loved a man but that love grew old
I gave him my heart, but he wanted my soul
Don't think twice, it's alright
Walking down that lone lonesome road, babe
Where I'm bound I can't tell
But goodbye is too good away, babe
So I'm gonna say farewell
But I ain't saying you treated me unkind
You could have loved me better, but no, I don't mind
But you just kinda wasted my precious time
Don't think twice, it's alright"
481,Down,Dolly Parton,"Spent all my money on everyone else
Why I just kept handing it out right and left
They didn't appreciate none of my help
I have found
Had me a man
I was so much in love
But he just walked off after using me up
I cried like a baby
It hurt me so much and I'm down
Yeah, I'm sure down
Chorus:
I know that I'm down but I'm gonna get up
I just need some time
Just need a little streak of good luck
And you know that it's rough when your bitting the dust like I am
You try to do right but tell me where does that get you
People just use you and then they forget you
Well it wont take me long
To get my feet back on solid ground
But now I'm down
When I get my life back in order again
Well I'll still be willing to help out my friends
And if you need some body or wished it had been, look around
I'll be spending my money on everyone else
Well I'll just be handing it out right and left
I'll find a new love i wont live by myself
I'm just down, now, yeah I'm down
Repeat Chorus
I know that I'm down
But I'm bound to get up"
482,Down From Dover,Dolly Parton,"I know this dress I'm wearing doesn't hide the secret
I have tried concealing
When he left he promised me that he'd be back
By the time it was revealing
The sun behind a cloud just casts the crawling shadow
Over the fields of clover
And time is running out for me I wish
That he would hurry down from Dover
He's been gone so long
When he left the snow was deep upon the ground
And I have seen a spring and summer pass
And now the leaves are turning brown
And any time a tiny face will show itself
Because waiting's almost over
But I won't have a name to give
It if he doesn't hurry down from Dover
From Dover, from Dover
My folks weren't understanding when they found out
They sent me from the home place
My daddy said if folks found out
He'd be ashamed to ever show his face
My mamma said I was a fool
And she did not believe it when I told her
That everything would be all right
Because soon he would be coming down from Dover
I found a place to stay out
On a farm takin' care of that old lady
She never asked me nuthin'
So I never talked to her about my baby
I sent a messgae to my mom
With a name and address of Ms. ol' Grover
And to make sure he got that information
When he came down from Dover
I loved him more than anything
And I could not refuse him when he needed me
He was the only one I'd loved
And I just can't believe that he was using me
He couldn't leave me here like this
I know it can't be so, it can't be over
He wouldn't make me go through this alone
Oh he'll be coming down from Dover
My body aches the time is here
It's lonely in this place where I'm lying
Our baby has been born but something's wrong
It's much too still I hear no crying
I guess in some strange way she knew
She'd never have a father's arms to hold her
And dying was her way of telling me
He wasn't coming down from Dover"
483,Down On Music Row,Dolly Parton,"Down on Music Row
Down on music Row
If you want to be a star
That's where you've got to go
I could feel a change a comin'
I left my hometown a hummin'
With my ol' guitar a strummin'
Songs that I had wrote
I was on my way to Nashville
I just couldn't hardly wait
'Till I could sing my songs
To the folks on Music Row
I got into Nashville early
Sleepy, hungry, tired and dirty
And on the steps of RCA
I ate a stale, sweet roll
In the fountain at the hall of fame
I washed my face and read the names
In the walkway of the stars
Down on Music Row
Down on Music Row
Down on music Row
If you want to be a star
That's where you've got to go
I waited there 'till eight o'clock

When office doors became unlocked
Then I started walkin'
Down the streets of Music Row
Just a walkin' up and down the street
Tryin' to find out who to see
To help me get on record
And to hear the songs I'd wrote
But I found it goin' rough
Everyone was all tied up
Either in a conference
Or in the studio
They said that I could leave a tape
But they'd suggest I didn't wait
'Cause everyone was awful busy
Down on Music Row
But I could feel that change a comin'
And I just kept right on a hummin'
With my ol' guitar still strummin'
All them songs that I'd wrote
And then Chet and Bob at RCA
Well, they listened to my songs that day
And they both told me that I was on my way
Down on Music Row
Down on Music Row
Down on music Row
If you want to be a star
That's where you've got to go"
484,Downtown,Dolly Parton,"When you're alone and life is making you lonely
You can always go downtown
When you got worries, all the noise and the hurry
Seems to help, I know, downtown
Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city
Linger on the sidewalks where the neon signs are pretty
How can you lose?
The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
And go downtown
Things'll be great when you're downtown
No finer place for sure, downtown
Everything's waiting for you
Don't hang around and let your problems surround you
There are movie shows, downtown
Or maybe you know some little places to go to
Where they never close, downtown
Just listen to the rhythm of the music that they're playin'
Making conversation while you're on the dance floor swayin'
Happy again
The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
And go downtown
Where all the lights are bright, downtown
Waiting for you tonight, downtown
You're gonna be alright now
And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to guide them along
So maybe I'll see you there
You can forget all your troubles
Just forget all your cares
And go downtown
Things'll be great when you're downtown
Don't wait a minute more, downtown
Everything's waiting for you
Downtown, where all the lights are bright
Downtown, waiting for you tonight
Downtown, you're going to be alright now
Get on, get on, get on downtown
Fade:
Downtown, where all the lights are bright
Downtown, waiting for you tonight
Downtown, you're going to be alright now
Get on, get on, get on downtown"
485,Dr Robert F Thomas,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
Dr. Robert F. Thomas 
May his name forever stand 
Dr. Robert F. Thomas 
Was a mighty, mighty man 
And he enriched the lives 
Of everyone that ever knew him 
And in my song I hope to sing 
Some of the praise that's due him 
Dr. Thomas was a man 
The Lord must have appointed 
To live among us mountain folks 
In eastern Tennessee 
And he delivered more than half 
The babies in those mountains 
Among those babies 
He delivered me 
There was no way to drive along 
The roads back in those mountains 
But Dr. Thomas got there 
Just the same 
He often rode on horseback 
To get where he was needed 
But if he had to walk 
He always came 
Dr. Robert F. Thomas 
May his name forever stand 
Dr. Robert F. Thomas 
Was a mighty, mighty man 
And he enriched the lives 
Of everyone that ever knew him 
And in my song I hope to sing 
Some of the praise that's due him 
Dr. Thomas was a friend 
A neighbor and a doctor 
Though he seldom got a dime 
For all he'd done 
And I remember lots of times 
We sent for Dr. Thomas 
But I don't recall a time 
He didn't come 
They say a man is judged 
By the deeds he does while livin' 
A judgement when he stands 
Before the Lord 
And I know heaven holds a place 
For men like Dr. Thomas 
And I know that he'll receive 
His just reward 
Dr. Robert F. Thomas 
May his name forever stand

Was a mighty, mighty man 
And he enriched the lives 
Of everyone that ever knew him 
And in my song I hope to sing 
Some of the praise that's due him"

Cause this dumb blonde ain't nobody's fool
When you left you thought I'd sit
An' you thought I'd wait
An' you thought I'd cry
You called me a dumb blonde
Ah, but somehow I lived through it
And you know if there's one thing this blonde has learned
Blondes have more fun
You flew too high up off the ground
It's stormy wheater an' had to come back down
But I've found new thread for my old spool

He's got you cryin', oh he's done it again
He's made a date and he didn't show
You know he's done this to you so many times
When you gonna let him go
He doesn't treat you little a lover should
He could be so downright cruel
Can't understand why you're hangin' with him
Girl, don't you be a fool
Go on and dump the dude
You know he's got a rotten attitude
He always leaves you in a cryin' mood
Take my advice, don't you think twice
Listen to what I'm telling you
Go on and dump the dude
You know that we've been friends for so many years
And I've never ever seen you this way
So torn apart, how he gets to your heart
With all the little games that he plays
Just give him up, get him out of your life
Promise me that once and for all
You're gonna tell him that it's over and done
The very next time he calls, ain't you now
Dump the dude
You know he's got a rotten attitude
He always leaves you in a cryin' mood
Take my advice, find somebody nice
Listen to what I'm telling you
Go on and dump the dude
Girl, I know you may think this is none of my business
But the fact that we're friends I believe that makes it my business
I care about you but I ain't preachin'
I think you should dump the dude
I don't know why you'd want to settle for less
When you could have so much more
You know that you deserve only the best
So what are you waiting for?

489,Eagle When She Flies,Dolly Parton,"She's been there, god knows she's been there
She has seen and done it all
She's a woman, she knows how to dish it out, or take it all
Her heart's as soft as feathers, still she weathers stormy skies
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies
A kliederscope of colours, you can toss her round and round
You can keep her, in your vision, but you never keep her down
She's a lover, she's a mother, she's a friend and she's a wife
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies
Gentle as the sweet magnolia, strong as steel her faith and pride
She's an everlasting shoulder, she's a leading post of life
She hurts deep, and when she weeps, she's just as fragile as a child
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies
She's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies
Oh bless her lord
She's an eagle when she flies"
490,Early Morning Breeze,Dolly Parton,"I open up my door to greet the early morning sun
Closing it behind me and away I do run
To the meadow where the meadow lark is singing in the tree
In the meadow I go walking in the early morning breeze
I cup my hands to catch a multi-colored butterfly
Perched upon the petals of flowers growing wild
Freeing it I watch it as it flies away from me
To visit with the flowers in the early morning breeze
Chorus:
Rainbow colored flowers kissed with early morning sun
The aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums
Drops of morning due still linger on the iris leaves
In the meadow where I'm walking in the early morning breeze
Misty-eyed I look about the meadow where I stray
For its there I find the courage to greet the coming day
For there among the flowers I kneel gently to my knees
To have a word with God in the early mornig breeze
2nd Chorus:
A rainbow colored meadow kissed with early morning sun
The aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums
Drops of morning due still linger on the iris leaves
In the meadow where I'm walking in the early morning breeze"
491,Elusive Butterfly,Dolly Parton,"You might wake up some morning
To the sound of something moving past your window in the wind
And if you're quick enough to rise
You'll catch the fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow
Out on the new horizon
You may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings
And if the sleep has left your ears
You might hear footsteps running through an open meadow
Don't be concerned, it will not harm you
It's only me pursuing something I'm not sure of
Across my dreams, with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love
You might have heard my footsteps
Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind
I might have even called your name
As I ran searching after something to believe in
You might have seen me runnin'
Through the long abandonned ruins of the dreams you left behind
If you remember something there
That glided past you followed close by heavy breathing
Don't be concerned, it will not harm you
It's only me pursuing something I'm not sure of
Across my dreams, with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love
Across my dreams, with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love
Across my dreams, with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love"
492,Endless Stream Of Tears,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
I cry awake at night and hug my pillow 
And pray that I will die before I wake 
No such luck 
Another day of cryin' 
Don't know how much more my old heart can break 
Flooded with these memories and emotions 
The tears like rain keep on falling down 
They say that I'll forget 
But my face is just as wet 
As it was the day you left this town 
Drowning in this endless, endless 
Drowning in an endless stream of tears 
It's relentless and I'm defenseless 
Drowning in an endless stream of tears 
I can't believe that I can talk about it 
I never thought I'd live to see this day 
But a broken heart won't kill you 
You just want to die 
But you have to go on livin' anyway 
I feel it through and through 
And I've never been so blue 
And I cried a river over you 
Drowning in this endless, endless 
Drowning in an endless stream of tears 
It's relentless and I'm defenseless 
Drowning in an endless stream of tears 
Oh, I'm drowning in this endless, endless 
Drowning in this endless, endless 
Drowning in this endless, endless 
Drowning in this endless stream of tears"
493,Even A Fool Would Let Go,Dolly Parton,"It's funny how love goes
'Cause I know this could never work out
But honey, how love grows
Even though there's no reason to doubt
This can never be
You keep saying, it's wrong
Neither one of us is free
Still I want to hold on
When even a fool would let go
'Cause he knows that there's no use in trying
Even a child would say no
When he knows that he'll end up crying
Tell me now, is it wise holdin' you
Even a fool would let go?
Love has no reason
Like the words in a song that don't rhyme
My love has no season
I just know that it's there all the time
Maybe, just you and me
I can't believe that it's wrong
Thinking about you and me
Just makes me want to hold on
When even a fool would let go
'Cause he knows that there's no use in trying
Even a child would say no
When he knows that he'll end up crying
Tell me now, is it wise holdin' you
Even a fool would let go?
Tell me now, is it wise holdin' you
When even a fool would let go?"
494,Evening Shade,Dolly Parton,"My chain of thought was broken by a sudden burst of laughter
Something badly needed to lighten up the chores
Seemed old Mrs. Bailey had accidentally fell
In the water being used to scrub the floors
Now Mrs. Bailey was the meanest matron at the home
She believed in lots of work with little play
And we laughed til we bent double
Though we knew we'd get in trouble
But trouble's all we had at evening shade
Now evening shade was where they claim to teach you understanding
Teach you love and keep you off the streets
And all the kids that live there are said to be a problem
Juvenile delinquents so to speak
But understanding isn't learned from punishment and anger
An iron hand has no gentle touch and love ain't learned from hate
The reason we were there is 'cause we had no one who cared
But they cared even less at evening shade
Little Susan Bradley, one night had wet her bed
Mrs. Bailey took the razor strap and beat her half to death
And I knew that something must be done to put an end to this
And so I started talking plans with the older kids
Plans were that Joe Johnson would steal the kerosene
And I would get some matches when nobody seen
Beckie Adams would make sure the kids were all outside
Billy Watson would look out for the evil eye
Now Mrs. Bailey took a nap at three o'clock each day
We knew that she'd be a'sleeping as the plans got underway
Now that it's all over and the sun is going down
There's no evening shade because we burned it to the ground
Evening shade was burning just like the hell it was"
495,Everything Is Beautiful,Dolly Parton,"When I look out over a green field of clover
Or watch the sun set at the end of the day
I get kind of moody when I see such beauty
And everything's beautiful in its own way.
When I see a fountain flow from a mountain
Or see April showers bring flowers to May
I can't help but ponder; life is such a wonder
And everything's beautiful in its own way.
Words can't describe what I feel inside
When I see the beauty in each coming day
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold
And everything's beautiful in its own way.
When I see the clouds form a black summer windstorm
That uproots the harvest and hurls it away
In the midst of such anger, destruction and danger
The storm's even beautiful in its own way.
When I see leaves drop off from the treetop
Or see the snow fall on a cold winter's day
My thoughts seem to wander into the blue yonder
God made all things beautiful in their own way.
Words can't describe what I feel inside
When I see the beauty in each coming day
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold
And everything's beautiful in its own way.
In its own way, in its own way..."
496,Everythings Beautiful In Its Own Way,Dolly Parton,"When I look out over a green field of clover
Or watch the sun set at the end of the day
I get kind of moody when I see such beauty
And every thing's beautiful in its own way
I see a fountain flow from a mountain
Or see April showers bring flowers to may
I can't help but ponder, life is such a wonder
And every thing's beautiful in its own way
Words can't describe what I feel inside
When I see the beauty in each coming day
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold
And every thing's beautiful in its own way
When I see the clouds form a black summer windstorm
That uproots the harvest and hurls away
In the midst of such anger, destruction and danger
The storm's even beautiful in its own way
When I see leaves drop off from the treetop
Or see the snow fall on a cold winter's day
My thoughts seem to wander into the blue yonder
God made all things beautiful in their own way
Words can't describe what I feel inside
When I see the beauty in each coming day
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold
And every thing's beautiful in its own way
In its own way, in its own way"
497,Falling Out Of Love With Me,Dolly Parton,"FALLING OUT OF LOVE WITH ME
Writer Dolly Parton
Copyright 1976
The hardest thing I've ever done or that I'll ever do
Was to just walk off and leave you but I knew I had to leave you
Cause I couldn't stay and watch you falling out of love with me
The worst pain that I've ever known or that I'll ever know
Was to see your love a dying and to have to watch it dying
And I couldn't stand to watch you falling out of love with me
It's hurtin' now but still it's better I left while love was still alive
It was dying and I'd rather I didn't have to watch it die
The deepest hurt I've ever felt or that I'll ever feel
Was to know that I was losing and I tried but I kept losing
And I couldn't stay to watch you falling out of love with me
The loneliest I've ever been or that I'll ever be
Is now that I'm without you and I feel so lost without you
But I couldn't stay and watch you falling out of love with me
I'm crying now but still it's better I left while love was still alive
But it was dying and I'd rather I didn't have to watch it die"
498,False Eyelashes,Dolly Parton,"Folks back home think I'm a star now when they hear my records play
They say there home town girl made good and she'd go a long long way
Mom wonders why I don't drive back in that big fine car I own
The truth is I don't have a car and I'm ashamed to go back home
A pair of false eye lashes and a tube of cheap lipstick
A pair of worn out high heel shoes and a dress doesn't fit
These are all my possessions all I have to my name
And a record played in my home town is my only claim to fame
I'm so glad that dad can't see me now, his favorite little girl
Singing in this dingy place on the wrong side of the world
And I'm glad that I can't see the boy that offered me his name
For I was blind and turned from him in this empty search for fame
A pair of false eye lashes and a tube of cheap lipstick
A pair of worn out high heel shoes and a dress doesn't fit
These are all of my possessions, all I have to my name
And a record played in my home town is my only claim to fame
Yes a record played in my home town is my only claim to fame"
499,Family,Dolly Parton,"When it's family, you forgive them for they know not what they do
When it's family, you accept them, 'cause you have no choice but to
When it's family, they're a mirror of the worst and best in you
And they always put you to the test
And you always try to do your best
And just pray for God to do the rest, when it's family
Some are preachers, some are gay
Some are addicts, drunks and strays
But not a one is turned away, when it's family
Some are lucky, others ain't
Some are fighters, others faint
Winners, losers, sinners, saints, it's all family
And when it's family you trust them and your heart's an open door
When it's family, you tolerate what you'd kill others for
When it's family, you love and hate and take, then give some more
Somehow you justify mistakes, try to find some better way
To solve the problems day to day, in the family
You take the trouble as it comes and love them more than anyone
Good or bad or indifferent, it's still family
You choose your lovers, you pick your friends
Not the family that you're in, nah
They'll be with you 'til the end, 'cause it's family
And when it's family, you forgive them for they know not what they do
When it's family, they're a mirror of the worst and best in you
When it's family, when it's family
Let me be all that I should be to the family"
500,Farther Along,Dolly Parton,"Tempted and tried, we're oft made to wonder
Why it should be thus all day long
While there are others living about us
Never molested though in the wrong
When death has come and taken our loved ones
It leaves our home so lonely and drear
Then do we wonder why others prosper
Living so wicked year after year
Farther along we'll know all about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother, live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all, by and by
Faithful 'til death, said our loving Master
A few more days to labor and wait
Toils of the road will then seem as nothing
As we sweep through the beautiful gates
Repeat Chorus"
501,Feels Like Home,Dolly Parton,"Something in your eyes, makes me want to lose myself
Makes me want to lose myself in your arms
There's something in your voice, makes my heart beat fast
Hope this feeling lasts
The rest of my life
If you knew how lonely my life has been
And how long I've felt so low
If you knew how I wanted someone to come along
And change my life the way you've done
(chorus)
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong
A window breaks down a long dark street
And a siren wails in the night
But I'm alright cause I have you here with me
And I can almost see through the dark there's light
If you knew how much this moment means to me
And how long I've waited for your touch
If you knew how happy you are making me
I've never thought I'd love anyone so much
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong
Feels like I'm all the way back, where I belong"
502,Fight And Scratch,Dolly Parton,"Fight and scratch fight and scratch that's all we ever do
There surely must be more to love than to fight and scratch with you
You you to fight and scratch with you
Well you just bought a foal last month now you want a wig
It looks like you couldn't understand my paycheck ain't that big
Well what about the dough you lose in them poker games downtown
(I figured you'd mention that smart aleck)
Yeah and that brand new boat and that fishin' gear
But no uhhuh I don't reckon that'd count really
Fight and scratch fight and scratch...
Sometimes I swear I think that you're the devil in disguise
Cause when you're mad you oughta see the fire fly from your eyes
Well you don't look so cute yourself when you're mad at me
And if you don't like the way I look then you know how to leave
Fight and scratch fight and scratch...
Well I love you and you love me but we're always findin' fault
But the way we fight you wouldn't know we had any love at all
We just fight like cats and dogs we'll leave then come right back
For what excitement would we have if we didn't fight and scratch
Fight and scratch fight and scratch...
Why don't you drop dead oh you'd like me to and I'll live forever just for spite
Why don't you keep your big mouth shot
Well why don't you just make me if you think you're big enough
Yeah and I could whip you with both hands tied behind
Yeah you just try it with me and I'll knock your brains out
With a stick of soap that's good Catfish
What's a catfish why'd you call me that
They're all mouth and no brains boy that's really good
It's all I can do to keep from laughin' hah
That's funny you sure are a funny little fellow"

504,Fighting Kind,Dolly Parton,"You and me cannot agree cause our love's the fightin' kind
Oh yes you did you started it like you start all our fights
No I didn't do no such thing and that a dirty lie
Nothin's ever your fault and nothin's ever mine
You and me cannot agree cause our love's the fightin' kind
Well you've burned the supper up again that's nothin' new
I just figured you'd pack that all on me
Well you're the one that caused it oh it's always me
When you're always lookin' faults ain't hard to find
We delight in pickin' fights cause our love's the fightin' kind
Two lovers both too stubborn to take the blame for anything
So we blame it on the other
Some love is understanding and there's careless love in line
It takes all sorts and mine and yours is known as the fightin' kind
Okay Miss Priss what is it now now I know you done this
What how am I supposed to shave that ain't never been my problem
Now I don't care about you using my razor
But did you have to use my brand new blade
New blade boy it's good that is really good
That's real good to think I went to all that trouble tryin' to fix that nice for you
That's fixed up nice I'll probably keep it for washin' the soap off the wall
Oh there ain't no soap or I ain't got no television in the bathroom
And that new blade that you vedrudged me had already been used
Two lovers both too stubborn to take the blame for anything
So we blame it on the other
What's mine is yours what's yours is yours and so on down the line
You and me cannot agree cause our love's the fightin' kind
You and me cannot agree cause our love's the fightin' kind"
505,Fires Still Burning,Dolly Parton,"Familiar sounds tell me it's morning the night has been so dark and long
Each night without you just gets longer
While this torch I still carry just burns stronger
I know I never will stop loving you my tears just can't put out the flame
Or drown my hopes of your returning cause baby the fire's still burning

Wherever you are I hope you're happy although your love for me has died
But if you ever need or want me I'll take you back any time
I know I never will stop...
Yes baby the fire's still burning"
506,Fish Out Of Water,Dolly Parton,"I feel so out of place here
With this high society
These high fallutin' people
Don't know what to make of me
I feel like a minnow in a sea of Moby Dicks
A small fry in a big pan
They're caviar -- I'm fish sticks
Fish out of water
I know I don't belong
Fish out of water
Everything I do is wrong
My style of hair, the clothes I wear
The way I speak, the things I eat
The way I act, my lack of tact
Nothin' seems to fit
Fish out of water
Flounderin' round
Out of my element
But I'm just as good as they are
Why do I feel second rate
It's like, ""Sorry Charlie,
We want only tuna with good taste""
I guess you could say Wal-Mart
Is quite a way from Gucci's
I'm Timex, they're Rolex
I'm Captain D's, they're sushi
Fish out of water
I've had it to the gills
Fish out of water
With these yuppie-guppie frills
Yeah, I'm a square in a round hole
A catfish in a goldfish bowl
A little fish with lots of soul
Out of my element
Fish out of water
Flounderin' round just for the Halibut
Save me, save me
S.O.S. somebody
Save me, save me
Somebody rescue me
Fish out of water
Somebody throw me in
Fish out of water
On a scale of one to ten
I'm a two, perhaps a three
Compared to the big fish in the sea
I'm washed ashore so save me please
I'm in an awful fix
Fish out of water
Rescue me
And you better do it quick
Fish out of water
It's such a culture shock
Fish out of water
My stomach's tied in knots
Fish out of water
Fish out of water"
507,Fog Has Lifted,Dolly Parton,"I can see the sunshine again
And I can see the blue sky where there once was fog and rain
We know each other now clear through and through
The fog has lifted between me and you
I loved you the first time I saw you
For it seemed like I had known you all my life
Well I loved you too but it takes a long time
To know what hurts you what helps you and know how you feel deep inside
I'm so happy you found out before it was too late
Our beautiful love could have turned into hate
Forgiving and understanding gives us a clear view
The fog has lifted between me and you
Now there's the sunshine again..."
508,Fool For Your Love,Dolly Parton,"Ooh, but love was just so hard to find
Till you came along into my life
And then I thought I would lose my mind
When you said that you wanted to be mine
And ever since that day I've been hooked
Nothing can turn me away
This living with you is like a dream come true
And it grows more and more everyday
Ooh, I'm reaching the highest of highs
Everytime I look into your eyes
You ask how I feel
I can say it out loud
I feel like a million inside
And I never thought this could happen to me
You got me just where you want me baby
And for your love I would do anything
Every night I'm a fool for your love
Chorus:
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm just a fool for your love
I'm a fool and can't get enough
Driving home from this sleepy old town
When my day's work is all through
The sun and the lights, well I wish I could fly
To get back faster to you
I waited all day by the telephone
Staring at the clock on the wall
The hours are so long when you're free from my arms
And I just can't wait to hold you
Repeat Chorus
Ooh, you're giving me chills up my spine
I'm feeling so fine, going out of my mind
And I don't care if it never stops
I love you right up until I drop, you know
Repeat Chorus
Fade:
Cause I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool, I'm a fool, I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool and can't get enough
Cause I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love"
509,For The Good Times,Dolly Parton,"Don't look so sad I know it's over
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that were burning
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times
I'll get along and you'll find another
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
They'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times
For the good times
For the good times"
510,Forever Love,Dolly Parton,"You touch me it's like no one else ever touched me
Kiss me and all other kisses just fade
No other arms come to mind when you hold me
As if ever knew that for you, I was made
You are my joy and my laughter
You are the moon and you gave the stars light
You are my ever after
Forever love, the light of my life
You wrote the book, each page and each chapter
You are my poetry, story and song
Each moment I try to capture
All of the magic that you bring along
Fantasy, romance, story-book feelings
Wrapped as a gift sent from Heaven above
I promise I'll always love you
I'm yours, forever, love
You are my joy and my laughter
I vow to drink only from your loving cup
You are my ever after
You're mine, forever love
You are my joy and my laughter
My ever after
My forever love
My cherished
Forever love"

Don't tell me you're sorry for thing you caused me
And from from now on you'll be true
And don't don't you ask me to forgive you again I'm fresh out of forgiveness

512,From Here To The Moon And Back,Dolly Parton,"I could hold out my arms
say ""I love you this much""
I could tell you how long
I will long for your touch
How much
and how far
would I go to prove
The depth
and the breadth
of my love for you?
From here
to the moon
and back
Who else in this world
will love you like that?
Love everlasting
I promise you that
From here
to the moon
and back
From here
to the moon
and back
I want you to know
you can always depend
On promises made
and love without end
No need to wonder
how faithful I'll be
Now
and on into
eternity
From here
to the moon
and back
Who else
in this world
will love you like that?
Forever
and always
I'll be where you're at
From here
to the moon
and back
From here
to the moon
and back
I would blow you a kiss
from the star where I sat
I would call out your name
to echo through the vast
Thank heaven for you
and to God
tip my hat
From here
to the moon
and back
And I'll spend forever
just proving that fact
From here
to the moon
and back"
513,Fuel To The Flame,Dolly Parton,"You kindle the fire of love inside me
Each time our lips meet
I'm not strong when we're alone
Your kisses make me weak
You must know how I feel
But do you feel the same
Everytime you kiss me
You add fuel to the flame
My eyes light up when I see you
I burn with desire
Each time you're near
You say you'll care
But still I'm not sure

But please don't ask me to love you
If you're not gonna change my name
Everytime you touch me
You add fuel to the flame
This fire you started inside me
Has reached my very soul
You're adding fuel to a flame
That's already burning out of control
When you give me your name
I give you everything
Everytime you kiss me
Adds fuel to the flame
Yes everytime you touch me
You add fuel to the flame"
514,Full Circle,Dolly Parton,"You've seen me naked in
more ways than one
You've seen me done up,
seen me come undone
We've cried in the
darkness, we've laughed
in the sun
We've been forever, yet
we've just begun
Chorus
We've come full circle, all
the way 'round
Though the good times,
the bad times, through
life's ups and downs
Still we've stayed together
through thick and
through thin
Yes, we've come full circle.
Thank God, we're
still friends
You know the soft spots
under my skin
Deep down inside me,
where no one has been
And we've sailed troubled
waters, we've soared
on the wind
But time's only sweetened
this love that we're in
Repeat Chorus
Tag
We've cried in the darkness,
laughed in the sun
We've come full circle and
we've just begun
We've come full circle,
we've been all the
way 'round
We've come full circle,
we've been all the
way 'round
You know we've cried in
the darkness, and we've
laughed in the sun
We've stayed
together, and we've
just begun
(fades)
We've come full circle,
we've been all the
way 'round
I'm so glad you're still
my friend
We've come full
circle, and I'd do
it again"
515,Gamble Either Way,Dolly Parton,"Being born was the worse and the first mistake i ever made
The doctor didnt spank me, he just slapped me in the face
And the cup of love was always quenching someone else's thirst
Leaving me to swallow the bitter taste of hurt
'cause i was raised an orphan
Never wanted as a kid until the year i turned 13
Then everybody did, strangers pass me back and forth
Men just took me as they pleased
And others had a cinderella slave to cook and clean and weep
Chorus:

Though the deck is stacked against you
Win or lose, you have to play
The hand a life has dealt you
And its A Gamble Either Way

On a dust road at 15 in a yellow cotton dress
With the desert sun like an angry dragon breathing down my neck
And the dry cracked plains would make me think of a prehistoric time
Or should i fear what lay before me less than what i'd left behind
A 15 year old girl dont have no trouble hitching rides
But sometimes when you're riding free
Youll pay the highest price
On back roads and in back seats
And in a cheap highway motel
But whats a few more strangers in a life of nothing else

Repeat chorus

16 caught me crying, underneath the scarlet light
On the door steps of a stranger on a cold and rainy night
When i walked into the parlour here
Other pieces seemed to fit
I was good at pleasing strangers
So i made the most of it

Either way its all a gamble
So view the stakes and know the odds
And lay your cards upon the table
Do all the dealing from the top

Repeat chorus"
516,Games People Play,Dolly Parton,"Oh the games people play now
Every night and every day now
Never meaning what they say now
Never saying what they mean
Oh they whine away the hours
In their ivory towers
Til they're covered up with flowers
In the back of a black limousine
Chorus:
La la la mmm da da da
La la la mmm da da dee
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play
Oh they make one another cry
Break their hearts and they say good-bye
Cross their heart and they hope to die
That the other was to blame
Neither one will ever give in
So they gaze at an eight by ten
Thinkin' 'bout the way it might have been
And it's a dirty rotten shame
Repeat Chorus
Oh they teach how to meditate
Read your horoscope and teach you faith
The furthermore the hell with hate
Come on and get on board
Look around and tell me what you see
What's a-happenin' to you and to me
God grant me the serenity
To just remember who I am
Repeat To Fade"
517,Get Out And Stay Out,Dolly Parton,"I used to need you, but then I finally learned
I used to want you, but now the tables turned
I used to love you, now it's your time to squirm
I'm saying goodbye and I won't wait for your return.
So get out and stay out, I've finally had enough
Don't kiss me on your way out, it wouldn't move me much
You used me, abused me, you cheated and you lied
So get out and stay out, I'm taking back my life
I wonder what you'll do when I am not around
Now that your new love has up and let you down
You've always come crying to me throughout the years
To mend another broken heart, to dry your selfish tears.
So get out and stay out, I'm moving on at last
Cause, I've been so foolish, but that was in the past.
I never thought I'd be the one to say goodbye
You get out and stay out, I'm taking back my life.
Dreams and plans are in the making
I just Wish it was as simple as it sounds
Life is out there for the taking
Now that I'm unfettered and unbound
You Get out and stay out, I've finally had enough
Don't kiss me on your way out, it wouldn't move me much
You used me, abused me, you cheated and you lied
So get out and stay out, I'm taking back my life
I'm taking back my life
I'm taking back my life
taking it back my life
I'm taking it back
I use to need you
I used to want you
I used to love him but now the tables turned."

519,Gettin Happy,Dolly Parton,"Without a love to call my own my life was incomplete
It seems I couldn't help but think that love was not for me
But my life took on a different twist when I met me a man that I couldn't resist
I didn't know what all I'd missed, and I'm a gettin' happy
Oh, I'm a gettin' happy
Yeah, I'm a gettin' happy - all my lonely days are gone
I'm a gettin' happy - no more lonely nights alone
I got someone to call my own and now my life is like a song
And he helps me sing along - I'm a gettin' happy
Oh, I'm a gettin' happy
Oh, people used to talk of love and I couldn't understand
About the fire and the desire in lovin' a good man
Oh, but now I know just what they meant since I met me a man that was Heaven sent
Wonder where the sadness went, cause I'm a gettin' happy
Oh, I'm a gettin' happy
I'm a gettin' happy - all my lonely days are gone
I'm a gettin' happy - no more lonely nights alone
I got someone to call my own and now my life is like a song
And he helps me sing along - an' I'm a gettin' happy
Oh, I'm a gettin' happy - whoo!
Yeah, I'm gettin' happy - all my lonely days are gone
I'm a gettin' happy - no more lonely nights alone
I got someone to call my own, now my life is like a song
Got someone to sing along and I'm a gettin' happy

I'm a gettin' happy - no more lonely nights alone
'Cause I'm a gettin' happy"
520,Getting In My Way,Dolly Parton,"I wish I could forget you, but I won't
I wish I loved another, but I don't
It's just the same, day after day
Your memory keeps getting in my way
But I'm hoping I will be alright
But I don't eat, don't sleep at night
I close my eyes I see your face
Your memory keeps getting in my way
Bridge:
I don't know why I can't forget you
I don't see why I should let you
Keep messing up my mind with all those thoughts of yesterday
Your memory keeps getting in my way
It's easy for someone to lie
Like saying I'll forget you and I'll try
Here's hoping that I will someday
Your memory keeps getting in my way
Repeat Bridge"
521,Go Tell It On The Mountain,Dolly Parton,"Go tell it on the mountain over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain that Jesus Christ is born
While shepherds kept their watch o'er silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens there shown a holy light
Go tell it on the mountain...
The shepherds feared and trembled when low above the earth
Rang out the angel chorus that hailed our Saviour's birth
Go tell it on the mountain...

Go tell it on the mountain...
Go tell it on the mountain..."
522,God Bless The Usa,Dolly Parton,"If tomorrow all the things were gone I'd worked for all my life
And I had to start all over with just my family by my side
I'd thank my lucky stars to be living here today
'Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away

And I'm proud to be an American where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the ones who died who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land...God bless the U.S.A.
From the lakes of Minnesota to the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas from sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston and New York to L.A.
There's pride in every American heart
And it's time we stand and say

Proud to be an American where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the ones who died who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land...God bless the U.S.A.
God Bless the U.S.A.
The U.S.A."
523,God Wont Get You,Dolly Parton,"Sometimes in my sleep I hold you close against my skin
Wakin' up I wish that I could sleep and dream again
'Cause only in my dreams can I know how it might have been
But cheaters never win, their heartaches never end
But sometimes I get crazy as lovers often do
Trying to please him and wondering if she's pleasin' you
Though they have ever right to any part of us they choose
I still live just for you and our secret rendezvous
Chorus:
Torn between two lovers on the jukebox
I'm thinkin' how I could have wrote that song
Wonderin' if God loves us when we're cheatin'
Oh, but why he lets us feel things if it's wrong
And I guess I should be gingin' ""Rock of Ages""
""Amazing Grace"" and some of those good songs
But my cheatin' heart will tell on me tomorrow
If you think that God won't get you, well you're wrong
Thou shalt not commit, it's written in the ten
The spirit's always willin', but the flesh is weak again
And you're as close to heaven as I might ever fly
And angel in disguise
A wrong that feels so right
Chorus:
Torn between two lovers just keeps playing
I don't want to be right if lovin' you is wrong
I'm wonderin' if God loves us when we're cheatin'
Oh, but why we have to feel things if it's so wrong
I guess I should be singin' ""Rock of Ages""
""Amazing Grace"" and some of those good songs
But my cheatin' heart will tell on me tomorrow
If you think that God won't get you, well you're wrong
My cheatin' heart will tell on me tomorrow
If you think that God won't get you, well you're wrong"
524,Gods Coloring Book,Dolly Parton,"Today as I was walking
In the fields just down the way
I sat down on a fallen log
To pass the time away
And as I looked around me
The more that I did look
the more I realize that I am viewing
God's coloring book
I saw a golden ray of sunlight
A silver drop of dew
A soft, white floating cloud
Sailing cross the sky 'a blue
A yellow dandelion
Pretty evergreen
And some red and orange flowers
Growing wild along the stream
And the more I look around me
And the more that I do look
The more I realize that I am viewing
God's coloring book
The greyness in an old man's hair
The pink in baby's cheeks
The blackness in a stormy sky
The brown in fallen leaves
And the multicolored rainbow
Stretched out across the sky
And the purple haze at sunset
Just before the night
And the more I look around me
And the more that I do look
The more I realize that I am viewing
God's coloring book
Then I turn my face toward the sky
And say a silent prayer
Though God doesn't speak to me
I see him everywhere
He is all around me
He's everywhere I look
And each new day is but a new page
In God's coloring book
Tag:
Each new day is but a new page
In God's coloring book

525,Golden Streets Of Glory,Dolly Parton,"Glory to His name, oh, holy, holy
There's a city where the streets are paved in gold
A land where the milk and the honey flow
And a mansion which for me
'Cause my bible tells the story
I just hope my feet are clean enough
To walk upon the golden streets of glory
Green meadows where the little children play
No sorrow there, just one long happy day
And none will litter there except the pure and the holy
I just hope my feet are clean enough
To walk upon the golden streets of glory
And when I've reached my journey's end
And if I'm worthy to go in
Golden streets of glory, I walk on
And the golden streets of my new home
Will lead me up to the master's throne
With the angel band I'll sing
Glory to His name, oh, holy, holy
I just hope my feet are clean enough
To walk upon the golden streets of glory
Hallelujah, I just hope my feet are clean enough
To walk upon the golden streets of glory
And when I've reached my journey's end
And if I'm worthy to go in
Golden streets of glory, I'll walk on
And the golden streets of my new home
Will lead me up to the master's throne
With the angel band I'll sing
Glory to His name, oh, holy, holy
I just hope my feet are clean enough
To walk upon the golden streets of glory
Hallelujah, I just hope my feet are clean enough
To walk upon the golden streets of glory"
526,Good Understanding,Dolly Parton,"GOOD UNDERSTANDING
Duet by Dolly Parton and Porter Wagoner
Writer Dolly Parton
Copyright 1970
When we married we agreed that we'd both do as we please
Just as long as we done each other right
Through the years our love has grown now our love is twice as strong
Cause we've got a good understanding
Yes we've got a good understanding and a love that has never been demanding
We both love each other so and that's all we need to know
Cause we've got a good understanding
It's been your unselfish love that has always helped me up
When temptation reached out its hand to see
And when I could have gone wrong I would think of you at home
And I'd think about our good understanding
Yes we've got a good understanding..."
527,Great Balls Of Fire,Dolly Parton,"You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love can drive a girl insane

528,Greeneyed Boy,Dolly Parton,"I flew off to the wild blue yonder
'Cause I had a dream
And I had to go
But I'm filled with a sense of wonder
From the love I shared
With a green-eyed boy
Lips as sweet as mountain honey
A body warm as home made wine
But he had no dreams
And no means for money
But he had me just anytime
Chorus:
Take me back, If just in memory
Fill my cup again with joy
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy
Now he was pretty
With chiseled features
Like the movie stars in the magazines
My first love and the son of a preacher
I fantasized me was James Dean
But the world outside kept pulling at me
Offered me fame, respect, and gold
Designer clothes and a fancy mansion
Expensive cars, so I chose those
Repeat Chorus Twice
Ooh, ooh, how I love that green-eyed boy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, and I still miss
That green-eyed boy
Fade:
Do you think about me
When the nights are long and cold
Do you ever miss me
Do you my green-eyed boy"
529,Gypsy Joe And Me,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
We might have slept in a rail yard or camped by the river bank
We fed ourselves from the fruit of the land and quenched our thirst with rain
We never did allow no roots to grow beneath our feet
Life just had no pattern for Gypsy Joe and me.
All we had was each other and the rags upon our back
The closest thing to a home we new was some abandoned shack
But we had all we needed and the rest we didn't need
Life was free and simple for Gypsy Joe and me.
Now Gypsy was my little dog, I found by the road in a ditch
And so I named him Gypsy, cause that name just seemed to fit
Oh and Joe he was my man, the flower of my soul
Thou he never said he loved me, I just always seemed to know.
While standing by the highway, thumbin' for a ride
The speeding wheels of a passing car, took Gypsy's life
I lost him where I found him and his loss was misery
Now there's no more Gypsy, there's just Joe and me.
Well, the winter came and the snow did fall and the night was cold and still
And the rags we wore were not enough and Joe he caught the chill
And he told me how he loved me and in my arms he went to sleep
Now there's no more Gypsy, no more Joe, there's just me.
While standin' here on the edge of this bridge lookin' down I see
The face of Joe and Gypsy, lookin' back at me
And somewhere in the distance I can hear them callin' me
Tonight we'll be together again Gypsy, Joe and me.
Yeah, tonight we'll be together again Gypsy Joe and me..."
530,Happy Happy Birthday Baby,Dolly Parton,"(M. Sylvia & G. Lopez)
Happy, happy birthday baby
Although you're with somebody new
Thought I'd drop a line to say
That I wish this happy day
Would find me beside you
Happy, happy birthday baby
No, I can't call you my baby
Seems like years ago we met
On a day I can't forget
Cause that's when we fell in love
Do you remember
The names we had for each other
I was your pretty
You were my baby
Oh, how could we say goodbye
Hope I didn't spoil your birthday
I'm not acting like a lady
So I'll close this note to you
With good luck and wishes too
Happy happy birthday baby"
531,Hard Candy Christmas,Dolly Parton,"Hey, maybe I'll dye my hair
Maybe I'll move somewhere
Maybe I'll get a car
Maybe I'll drive so far they'll all lose track
Me, I'll bounce right back
Maybe I'll sleep real late
Maybe I'll lose some weight
Maybe I'll clear my junk
Maybe I'll just get drunk on apple wine

But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down
I'll be fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow

Maybe I'll just leave town
Maybe I'll have some fun
Maybe I'll meet someone and make him mine

532,Harper Valley Pta,Dolly Parton,"I want to tell you all a story 'bout a harper valley widow wife
Who had a teenage daughter that attended harper valley junior high
Well her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
And she said, mama, I've got a note here from the harper valley pta
Well the note says mrs. johnson, you're wearing your dresses way too high
It's been reported you've been drinkin' and a runnin' round with men and goin' wild
Now we don't believe you ought to be a bringin' up your little girl this way
And it was signed by the secretary, harper valley pta
Well it happened that the pta was gonna meet that very afternoon
And boy, were they surprised as mrs. johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard I can still recall the word she had to say
She said I'd like to address this meeting of the harper valley pta
Now there's bobby taylor sittin' there and seven times he's asked me for a date
And mrs. taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away
And mr. baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town
And shouldn't widow jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled completely down
Now mr. harper couldn't be here 'cause he's stayed too long in kelly's bar again
And if you smell shirley thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me as a mother you think that I ain't fit
Well this is just a little payton place and you're all harper valley hypocrits
Now I wouldn't put you on because it really did, it happened just this way
That day my mama socked it to the harper valley pta
That day my mama socked it to 'em at the harper valley pta"
533,He Left Me Love,Dolly Parton,"He left me love enough to last a lifetime a lifetime filled with loving memories
And so I have no reason to search for new love time could never take his love
from me
And my mind is filled with mem'ries sweet and tender
My heart is filled with love he left for me
And each thought of him just makes the love grow sweeter
He left me love to last eternally
I just close my eyes and I still see him
And in dreams he loves me just like he used to do
Even wakes me with a tender kiss every morning
A kiss that lingers on my lips the whole day through
And my mind is filled...
Oh yes he left me love"
534,He Rode All The Way To Texas,Dolly Parton,"A light shines from my window
Just can't sleep no more
Lord, it hurts so much to be alone
But the real men never do admit
It's them that might be wrong
At least that's what he told me in his song
He rode all the way to Texas
On an old freight train
Didn't miss the girl he left behind
He rode all the way to Texas
Didn't shed a tear
He's lettin' you know that he's the movin' kind
The freedom that he sings about
I guess, I'll never know
Just can't shake the guilt or kill the pain
But he lets me ride when the lights turn low
Get on board the radio
And take a ride to Texas on his train
He rode all the way to Texas
On an old freight train
Didn't miss the girl he left behind
He rode all the way to Texas
Didn't shed a tear
Lettin' you know that he's the movin' kind
He's lettin' you know that he's the movin' kind"
535,He Would Know,Dolly Parton,"In my mind I've made love to you often
But only in my mind can it be so
'Cause there's someone at home that's countin' on me
And if I did, I'm sure that he would know
Yes, he would know, yes, he could tell
For, he has loved me long enough to know me very well
And if I lied, he'd see it in my eyes
I know my guilt would show and he would know
But I must admit you're someone very special
And it would be so easy to let go
Makin' love to you could be so easy
But if I did, I'm sure that he would know
Yes, he would know, yes, he could tell
For, he has loved me long enough to know me very well
And if I lied, he'd see it in my eyes
I know my guilt would show and he would know
My conscience just won't let me make love to you
I know it would be sweet, but I just can't
When I go home to him I must be able
To look him in the eyes and say I ain't
'Cause he would know, yes, he could tell
For, he has loved me long enough to know me very well
And if I lied, he'd see it in my eyes
I know my guilt would show and he would know
He would know"
536,Hes A Go Getter,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
He's a go-getter, a go-getter
When his wife gets off from work he'll go get her.
Now I've got a neighbor that lives down the road away
His wife holds down a steady job he don't turn his hand all day
I know that most of you will know the kind I'm talking about
The kind that rather than have to work yeah he'd rather do without.
But he's a go-getter, a go-getter...
When his wife gets off from work he'll go get her.
--- Instrumental ---
There's a group of men in the courthouse yard anytime that you go by
Playin' checkers and tradin' knives and makin' jokes about their wives
They'll wait all week for payday and they hope that money's plenty
And the wife that worked those long hard hours never gets a penny.
But he's a go-getter, a go-getter
When his wife gets off from work he'll go get her.
Yes he's a go-getter, a go-getter
When his wife gets off from work he'll go get her.
He's a go-getter, a go-getter
When his wife gets off from work he'll go get her..."
537,Hes Alive,Dolly Parton,"The gates and doors were barred
And all the windows fastened down
I spent the night in sleeplessness
And rose at every sound
Half in hopeless sorrow
And half in fear the day
Would find the soldiers breakin' through
To drag us all away
And just before the sunrise
I heard something at the wall
The gate began to rattle
And a voice began to call
I hurried to the window
Looked down into the street
Expecting swords and torches
And the sound of soldiers' feet
But there was no one there but Mary
So I went down to let her in
John stood there beside me
As she told me where she'd been
She said they've moved Him in the night
And none of us know where
The stone's been rolled away
And now His body isn't there
We both ran towards the garden
Then John ran on ahead
We found the stone and empty tomb
Just the way that Mary said
But the winding sheet they wrapped Him in
Was just an empty shell
And how or where they'd taken Him
Was more than I could tell
Oh something strange had happened there
Just what I did not know
John believed a miracle
But I just turned to go
Circumstance and speculation
Couldn't lift me very high
'Cause I'd seen them crucify Him
Then I saw Him die
Back inside the house again
The guilt and anguish came
Everything I'd promised Him
Just added to my shame
When at last it came to choices
I denied I knew His name
And even if He was alive
It wouldn't be the same
But suddenly the air was filled
With a strange and sweet perfume
Light that came from everywhere
Drove shadows from the room
And Jesus stood before me
With His arms held open wide
And I fell down on my knees
And I just clung to Him and cried
Then He raised me to my feet
And as I looked into His eyes
The love was shining out from Him
Like sunlight from the skies
Guilt in my confusion
Disappeared in sweet release
And every fear I ever had
Just melted into peace
He's alive yes He's alive
Yes He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive yes He's alive
Oh He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive He's alive
Hallelujah He's alive
He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive He's alive He's alive
I believe it He's alive
Sweet Jesus"
538,Hes Everywhere,Dolly Parton,"He walks in my mind like a shadow
Someone speaks his name and he appears
I can see his face in total darkness
Oh, he's everywhere
He left a memory that lives with me
A memory of how it used to be
And I remember all the things we used to share
Oh, he's everywhere
He waits in the corners of my mind
And in the stillness of the night, he walks around
Sometimes his memory's so real I think he's really there
Oh, he's everywhere
He left a memory that lives with me
A memory of how it used to be
I remember all the things we used to share
Oh, he's everywhere
Oh, he's everywhere"
539,Head Over High Heels,Dolly Parton,"Head Over High Heels""
Put on my tight dress
Hair teased on my head
I painted my lips red
And my eyes like Adele
I step in my high shoes
Cheeks blushed in rose rouge
I'm lookin' too cool
But you never can tell
When I look in his face
My heart begins to race
It's just a disgrace
These thoughts that I think
When he holds me to him
I want to woo him
I want to undo him
And don't think I ain't
Head over high heels
I'm head over high, high heels
Head over high heels in love
I've never known such thrills
I can't believe how this feels
I'm head over high heels in love
Head over high heels in love
Oh, racing heart be still
I'm hoping he will
Make love to me 'til the sun's comin' up
Have mercy on my soul
I'm losing control
Head over high heels and I can't get enough
Well I put on my sexy dress
Hair piled on my head
Painted my lips red
I got a hot date tonight
I step in my high shoes
Cheeks blushed in rose rouge
I'm feeling too cool
Even glittered my eyes
Head over high heels
I'm head over high, high heels
Head over high heels in love, in love
I've never known such thrills
I can't believe how this feels
I am head over high heels in love
Sure enough, I'm head over high heels in love
Can't get enough
I'm head over high heels in love
I'm head over high heels in
Love
Head over high heels in love"
540,Headlock On My Heart,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
Backstory:
Tabloid prediction: Dolly Parton will announce she's falling madly in love with a 300 pound professional wrestler. She'll write a song about their relationship titled ""Headlock on My Heart"" and feature her massive muscleman in the video.
Dolly: Now this actually came out in this magazine. Now, you folks I'm sure buy these every week at the supermarket, right? And you know they never put anything in these magazines that's not true, right? So I figured since I was gonna fall in love anyhow, why wait? So I went out and I found me a 300 pound wrestler and I sat down and I wrote a song called ""Headlock on My Heart"" and I did a video. As a matter of fact, in the same magazine on a page opposite, there was a picture of Hulk Hogan. Now, I love Hulk Hogan. My Daddy's crazy about him, so I called Hulk, I said ""Would you do this?"" 'Cause the song is a fantasy, and it's about a guy named Starlight Starbright. He said ""Aw sure, I'd do anything with you, Dolly!"" I said ""Well, thanks, Hulk, I ought to hug your neck!"" So wouldn't that be something if me and Hulk really wound up getting married? Watch this video...
Song:
The first time that I saw him
Was in a wrestling magazine.
Then I watched him on TV,
Then I bought a ringside seat.
His name was Starlight Starbright,
The greatest in the land.
He sprinkled stardust in my eyes
I was his biggest fan.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
It was a takedown from the start.
He's a master of the art.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
Spoken:
Referee: 300 pounds of magic right here in the ring tonight.
Starlight Starbright: Wrestling fans, big and small, who's the greatest of them all?
Dolly: Starlight! Starlight Starbright! Starlight! Starlight Starbright!
He dazzled 'em with brilliance,
He outshined all the rest.
And I loved the heart that beat
Beneath his massive golden chest.
Spoken:
Dolly: In this ring, I thee wed.
Referee: Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?
Starlight Starbright: I do!
Referee: And do you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?
Dolly: I do, I truly do!
Referee: I now pronounce you man and wife.
Dolly: Uh, you may now kiss the bride.
He's got a headlock on my heart,
That it may likely never part.
He knew the ropes right from the start.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
Spoken:
Dolly: Well, it's a whole new arena for me,
But it's a whole new wrestling match for him.
I guess you could say he pinned me down for a lifetime.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
It was a takedown from the start.
He's a master of the art.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
He's got a headlock on my heart,
That it may likely never part.
He knew the ropes right from the start.
He's got a headlock on my heart."
541,Heartbreak Express,Dolly Parton,"Packin' my suitcase writin' a tear stained good-bye note
Sayin' so long to a love gone wrong and that's all she wrote
Leavin' behind what once was mine with sad regrets
But it's all gone now and I'm leavin' town on the Heartbreak Express
Walkin in the rain with a heart full of pain to the train depot
The only things that's gonna keep me warm now is my overcoat
Lost and lonely waitin in line at the ticket desk
Hey mister won't you give me a one-way ticket on the Heartbreak Express
I'm gonna roll on down the line
I'm gonna go so far I'm gonna get it off my mind
It hurts to know it ain't enough when you give your best
Got a ticket to ride and I'm leavin tonight on the Heartbreak Express
Oh I couldn't hold a candle to a flaming beauty that caught his eye
It's killin' me now but I won't stay around and let him watch me die
Oh it just goes to show you never do know 'cause I never would'a guessed
I'd be sittin' here now on a train sorrow bound called the Heartbreak Express
I'm gonna roll on down the line
I'm gonna go so far I'm gonna get it off mt mind
Maybe someday somewhere someway I will forget
But there's no goin' back so roll down the track you ole Heartbreak Express
Feelin' alone while a low whistle moans
On the Heartbreak Express"
542,Heartbreaker,Dolly Parton,"Here I sit, all alone,
Thinkin' bout what I should of known,
You make me think that I could need you,
You weaved your magic spell and I believed you.
Looking back, on you and me,
Promises that will, never be,
I truely thought that we were lovers, (lovers)
But now I find i'm just like all the others.
Heartbreaker, wish i'd seen that love was blind,
Sweet little love maker, taking my heart and leaving me behind,
Heartbreaker, couldn't you be just a little more kind, to me?
Played with fire, felt it's burn,
I would have thought that I would of learned,
I melted every time you kissed me, (kissed me)
Everytime you'd leave I thought you'd miss me.
Heartbreaker, wish i'd seen that love was blind,
Sweet little love maker, taking my heart and leaving me behind,
Heartbreaker, couldn't you be just a little more kind, to me?
Heartbreaker, wish i'd seen that love was blind,
Sweet little love maker, taking my heart and leaving me behind,
Heartbreaker, couldn't you be just a little more kind, to me?
Heartbreaker, wish i'd seen that love was blind,
Sweet little love maker, taking my heart and leaving me behind,
Heartbreaker, couldn't you be just a little more kind, to me?"
543,Heartsong,Dolly Parton,"Chorus:
A heartsong melody plays like a symphony
The sweetest music I have ever known
A song of joy and pain
The mountain angels sing
A bittersweet refrain of my Smoky Mountain home, heartsong
Farmer's daughter if you will
And I often wonder still
In memories where I rambled as a child
Makes me cry and makes me laugh
My reflections on the past
And the family, friends, and faith that shaped my life
Ragged clothes and hand-me-downs
Just enough to go around
But the sweetest things in life are always free
Like the songs the birds would sing
And the sweet new grass of spring
And the sacred blossoms on the dogwood tree
Repeat Chorus
And I recall the thrill and joy
Of a Smoky Mountain boy
I remember my first kiss and my first love
And the songs I'd song and write
And the dreams I'd clutch so tight
And the loved ones that gave me that extra shove
And in that little house 'a prayer
Where I spent many hour
Praisin' God and liftin' up His name
And asking Him to lead and to keep watch over me
As I headed up that rocky road to fame
And now this, Smoky Mountain girl has been all around the world
But it makes no difference just how far I roam
I still cling to that part that is so dear to my heart
My faith in God and memories of home
Repeat Chorus"

545,Hello God,Dolly Parton,"
Hello God, are you out there?
Can you hear me, are you listening any more?
Hello God, if we're still on speaking terms
Can you help me like before?
I have questioned your existence
My resistance leaves me cold
Can you help me go the distance?
Hello God, hello, hello

This old world has gone to pieces
Can we fix it, is there time?
Hate and violence just increases
We're so selfish, cruel and blind
We fight and kill each other
In your name, defending you
Do you love some more than others?
We're so lost and confused

Hello God, are you out there?
Can you hear us, are you listening any more?
Hello God, if we're still on speaking terms
Can you help us like before?
Oh, the free will you have given
We have made a mockery of
This is no way to be living
We're in great need of your love
Hello God

Hello God, can you grant us
Love enough to make amends
(Hello God) Is there still a chance
That we could start again
Hello God, we've learned our lesson
Dear God, don't let us go
More than ever
Hello God, hello, hello
Hello God, we really need you
We can't make it without you
(Hello God) We beseech you
In the name of all that's true
Hello God, please forgive us
For we know not what we do

Hello God, give us one more chance to prove ourselves to you
Hello, God; hello, God"
546,Help,Dolly Parton,"Help, I need somebody
Help, not just anybody
Help, I need somebody
Please, please, help me
When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now those days are gone and I'm not so self-assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and I've opened up the door
Help me if you can, I'm feelin' down
And I do appreciate you bein' 'round
Won't you help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways

547,Her And The Car And The Mobile Home,Dolly Parton,"Well my wife and I were happy in our trailer
But she didn't dig my runnin' around all night
Well I warned you a couple of times of leavin'
Oh but you just laughed and took it kinda light
Well I should've paid attention to her warnin'
When she told me she'd leave if I didn't change
Cause when I come home about sunup this mornin'
Well I detected something mighty strange
Her and the car and the mobile home are gone boys
I was takin' off while you was a carryin' on
Now things are really shot I came home to an empty lot
Yeah me and the car and the mobile home was gone
Yeas her and the car and the mobile home was gone
Well the neighbors all around me were a laughin'
And it made me feel about ten inches tall
Ha I knew you didn't think that I'd really leave you
Ah not to mention taking home and all
Well talk about somebody be-wildered
I bet you didn't know what to do nor where to go
I found a little consolation in my wardrobe
That you left scattered on the patio
Her and the car and the mobile home...
Yeah they was gone with everything else
Except a few old western suits she'd left scattered there on the patio
And they had mud on 'em where she'd stomped around on 'em
Stepped on them Wagon wheels busted the spokes out
You know that real nice lavander suit one that she said I looked good in
Said I looked like Tom Jones that's it hangin' over in that tree
She took that piece of chalk wrote across the front of the coat
have a good time darling you know when you're hot you're hot"

And my goose-down underwear will have to go

557,Hillbilly Willy,Dolly Parton,"HILLBILLY WILLY
Writer Dolly Parton
Copyright 1967
Now little Will was from the hills a way back in the styx
He got his reputation from turning on them country chicks
He drove a super hot rod car but he he could really
Knock those little girls off their feet yeah hillbilly Willy
He'd talk that ol' sweet lovers talk with a hillbilly drawl
Willy wasn't much for looks he was only five feet tall
When he talked that ol' sweet talk he drove those little girls silly
They stood in line waitin' for their time to court hillbilly Willy
Then this country cyclop who measured six foot nine
Came up to little Will and said (you stole that little girl of mine)
Then there was an awful brawl boy it was a dilly
When the fighting stopped there on top stood hillbilly Willy
Now the moral of this story is to be a lover you got to be tough
Even if you're just five feet tall you got to be able to strut your stuff
Now to all you lovers in radio land if your lovelife's a little chilly
Bear in mind the rough tough kind like hillbilly Willy
Just bear in mind the rough tough kind like hillbilly Willy"
558,Hobos Meditation,Dolly Parton,"Tonight as I lay on the boxcar
Just waiting for a train to pass by
What will become of the hobo
When his time comes to die
There's a Master up yonder in heaven
Got a place that we might call our home
Will we have to work for a living
Or can we continue to roam
Will there be any freight trains in heaven
Any boxcars in which we might hide
Will there by any tough cops or brakemen
Will they tell us that we cannot ride
Will the hobo chum with the rich man
Will we always have money to spare
Will they have respect for the hobo
In that land that lies up there
Repeat Chorus"

Oh for sake not the the way of salvation my boy
That you've learned from your mother at home
In your satchel you'll find there's a Bible my boy
It's the book of all others the best
It will teach you to live and prepare you to die

Reach out you arms
And hold me
Hold me
When life is demanding
When I need understanding
Reach out
Reach out and hold me
Hold me
Hold me"
561,Holdin On To Nothin,Dolly Parton,"We're holding on with nothin' left to hold onto
I'm so tired of holding on to nothin'
The years have shown no kindness for the hard times we've been through
We've squeezed the life from every dream and still go right on bluffin'
With really nothin' left to hold onto
Oh, why do we keep holding on with nothin' left to hold onto
Let's be honest with each other, that's the least that we can do
I feel guilty when they envy me and you
We're holding on with nothin' left to hold onto
We were young and foolishly mistaken
Victims of a passion much too strong to be denied
With only tears to show for all the years that we've been fakin'
God only knows how long, how hard we tried
Oh, why do we keep holding on with nothin' left to hold onto
Let's be honest with each other, that's the least that we can do
I feel guilty when they envy me and you
We're holding on with nothin' left to hold onto
We're holding on with nothin' left to hold onto"
562,Holdin On To You,Dolly Parton,"There are those who'd love to love me
Take me home and take care of me
Treat me just the way you never do
But I'm here on your door step
Something I can't seem to help
Like a fool, I'm holdin' on to you
Chorus:
Oh, you don't love me, you don't love me
You place everything above me
Like a fool, I'm holdin' on to you
You don't want me, you don't want me
You just hurt and disappoint me
Like a fool, I'm holding on to, ooh, ooh
Like a fool, I'm holding on to you
What is this spell that's on me
Make me think you own me
Why do I keep holding on to you
I just can't shake the feeling
I only know it's real
And I keep holding, holding, holding on to you
Repeat Chorus
Fade:
Holding, holding onto you
Holding, holding onto you
I just keep holding, holding onto you
Holding, holding onto you
Holding, holding onto you
I just keep holding
I just keep holding
I just keep holding, holding onto you
Why do I keep holding, holding onto you
Holding, holding onto you
Holding, holding onto you"
563,Holding Everything,Dolly Parton,"My heart beats - wild and deep
Every thought in my mind has your name on it
Hard to breathe - I can't speak
Think of your love and just how much I want it

When I'm touching you - I feel a sudden change
When I'm kissing you - I taste the sun and rain
When I look at you - I hear the angels sing
And when I'm holding you... I'm holding everything
Everything that's mine to give
Everything I can do - I'll do to prove it
For as long (for as long)
As I may live (as I may live)
My love will be there for you to use it

Everything - I'm holding everything
When I'm touching you - I'm touching everything
When I'm kissing you - I'm kissing everything
Everything (everything) uh huh
My heart beats - wild and deep
Every thought in my mind has your name on it
It's hard to breathe (it's hard to breathe)
And I can't speak (I can't speak)
Think of your love and just how bad I - want it
And when you're touching me - I feel a sudden change
When you're kissing me - I taste the sun and rain

565,Hollywood Potters,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
Mother's hold on to your sons and you daughters 
Should Hollywood claim them, you'll hold then no more 
Cause they'll become claimed to the Hollywood potters 
And there's no escape once they walk through that door 
Hollywood, Hollywood Dungeon of Drama 
Center of sorrow, city of schemes 
Hollywood, Hollywood Terrace of Trauma 
Palace of promises, dealer in dreams 
Some, they go hungry and some go insane 
Some go to the bottle and some to the vains 
Some become users and some become used 
And some even make it, but most never do 
Hollywood, Hollywood Dungeon of Drama 
Center of sorrow, city of schemes 
Hollywood, Hollywood Terrace of Trauma 
Palace of promises, dealer in dreams 
You spin them around like a merry-go-round 
You mold them and shape them and then throw them down 
All of your glitter and all of your gold 
Is that what you give in exchange for a soul 
Cause they sell their soles for the likes of you 
While you chew up and spit out what you cannot use 
Mother's hold on to your sons and you daughters 
Should Hollywood claim them, you'll hold then no more 
Cause they'll become claimed to the Hollywood potters 
And there's no escape once they walk through that door 
Hollywood, Hollywood Dungeon of Drama 
Center of sorrow, city of schemes 
Hollywood, Hollywood Terrace of Trauma 
Palace of promises, dealer in dreams"
566,Home,Dolly Parton,"Looking out at my window pane
Tears lingering with the rain
I'm so lonesome, I could cry
Just like old Hank
Staring down on the city street
Feeling empty and incomplete
There's a place I need to be
To feel my day
A place I can go
Where I can be free
Where I can be happy and
Just be me
Home, where the long wind's blowing
And the river's is flowing
Run along, like a lazy bum in
The midnight summer night
Run along, fishing with a friend
And a fishing hope
Rocking, lay down my heavy load
Know that I am always welcomed home
I left home, I was 17
I had a lot of ambitious dreams
Seen a lot of those dreams come true
I had good luck
I ain't complaining, that's for sure
I got a lot to be thankful of
One of those things is a magic door
That opens up
Back to the time when I was a kid
With the sounds of a cricket and it's called home
On the front porch singing and furn pots hanging
Home, with the church bells ringing and voices singing
Old songs that's in my mind like a stitch in time
where the tea is sweet and the love complete
I wanna go home
I often think about where I have been,
Where I'm going and lots about when I think about home
Where the soul find confort and the heart find pleasure
Home where the depths of love it's hard to measure it's home
I hear you calling
I hear you calling
I'll never been lost as long as I know
Here's a place like that Where I can go,
Where I can restore my weary soul on the mountain slope of the south blue smoke of home
Home sweet home
Home back to the hills of the wipper wills
home with the fire flies blinking and the night stars twinkling
home hone suckle wine and muskey fine wine at home
with family and friend and joy that never end
home there's no place like it, no place like it, home"
567,Home For Petes Sake,Dolly Parton,"I became a woman of the world cause I was fed up with the farm
And I thought pretty clothes and city lights
Running round both day and night could do no harm
A party girl I mixed for bout myself into a fix for running wild
So I wrote my dad and mom asked if I could come back home to have my child
I received the letter from the folks back home and they said things were fine
They went on to say that Pete the boy I broke up with was about to lose his mind
But I couldn't hardly read the rest the words were being bloted by my tears
I'm feelin' so ashamed he loved me then he feels the same he still cares
So I'm going home for Pete's sake it was I who broke his heart in the first place
If he'll try me one more time for then I've made up my mind
And in the morning I'm going home for Pete's sake
Yes for Pete's sake my baby's and mine"
568,Home Is Where The Hurt Is,Dolly Parton,"We're well known in every honky tonk in town
Not a night goes by that we don't make the rounds
People wonder why we choose to live this way
Why don't they ever stay at home I hear them say
But home is where the hurt is
Cause love doesn't live there anymore
Home is where the hurt is
That's why we don't stay at home much anymore

What was once our happy home has come to be
A place to fuss and fight and disagree
Our lonely house with wall to wall regret
And these bright lights somehow help us to forget
Cause home is where the hurt is...
That's why we don't stay at home much anymore"
569,Honky Tonk Angels,Dolly Parton,"As I sit here tonight the jukebox's playing
The tune about the wild side of life
As I listen to the words you are saying
It brings mem'ries when I was trusting wife
It was't God who made honky tonk angels
As you wrote in the words of your song
Too many times married men think they're still single
That has caused many a good girl to go wrong
It's a shame that all the blame is on us women
It's not true that only you men feel the same
From the start most every heart that's ever broken
Was because there always was a man to blame
It was't God who made honky tonk angels...
That has caused many a good girl to go wrong"
570,Honky Tonk Songs,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
Bartender won't you pour me a very strong drink 
Just keep it coming till I don't have to think 
And point out some cowboy that might want to dance 
And make sure I get home if you see that I can't 
You see I loved him, he left me for a girl half my age 
I relate to each sad song that ole jukebox has played 
I listen to Haggard, ole Hank, and George Jones 
But why don't more women sing honky tonk songs? 
Why don't more women sing honky-tonk songs? 
About the heartaches and the tough breaks 
And the men that's done 'em wrong 
There are others just like me that are hurtin' to the bone 
So why don't more women sing honky-tonk songs 
Why don't more women sing honky tonk songs 
Honky tonk angels are just queens without thrones 
Judge not lest you be judged, who can cast the first stone 
Why don't more women sing honky-tonk songs 
Bartender won't you pour me a very strong drink 
Just keep it coming till I don't have to think 
And point out some cowboy that might want to dance 
And make sure I get home if you see that I can't 
(All you lonely women sing) 
Why don't more women sing honky tonk songs 
About the heartaches and the tough breaks 
And all the men that's done us wrong 
There's a whole lotta women I know would sing along 
So why don't more women sing honky tonk songs 
Why don't more women sing honky tonk songs"

572,House Of The Rising Sun,Dolly Parton,"There is a house down in New Orleans
Down in the Vieux Carr'e
A house they call the rising sun
Where love and money are made
My father he was a gambler
Mother died when I was young
And I've worked since then
To please the men
At the house of the rising sun
There is a house
Down in New Orleans
They call the rising sun
It's been the ruin of many a good girl
And oh God, you know I'm one
So mothers you go telling all your daughters
Not to do what I've done
To live a life of sin, shame and strife
In the house of the rising sun
There is a house in New Orleans
They call the rising sun
It's been the ruin of many a good girl
And oh God, you know I'm one
Oh God, you know I'm one"
573,House Where Love Lives,Dolly Parton,"A squeaky gate a welcome mat a big shaggy dog that lives out back
And some might even call it a shack but this is a house where love lives
The paint is peeling off of the cells the mailbox is full of bills
And it's no mansion on the hill but this is a house where love lives
There's a little boy who looks just you with freckles on his nose and eyes of blue
A little girl almost two and everybody says she looks just like you
So thank you dear for loving me though I know rich we'll never be
But that doesn't matter to you and me cause we live in a house where love lives

So thank you dear for loving me...
We live in a house where love lives"
574,How Close They Must Be,Dolly Parton,"On a park bench on sunny afternoon
Sat a young boy and a girl bout seventeen
As we stood so closely by watched them hold each other's hand
On their faces love had written we're making plans
Then he said to her you're my guiding light
Then she said to him you make my whole world seem so bright
Then we saw their books of braille and that neither one could see
Then I thought how close they must be
Souch tenderness my eyes have never seen
Two young lovers both just in their teens
Though their world gives them no light they see much more than you and me
Don't you know how close they must be
Then a car stopped just a few steps away
And a voice said Jim and Jeannie it's time to go
With their hands still clutched so tight helping each other to the car
Can you imagine just how close they are
Don't you know how close they must be"
575,How Does It Feel,Dolly Parton,"I know that you're out there
Knowing that there's someone out here thinkin' of you
In your heart and in your mind
I know there is no doubt that someone loves you
I know that you know
That I'll be waiting here when you have need of me
And when the world has chained you down
I know you know my love will set you free
Chorus:
How does it feel to know that someone loves you
How does it feel to know that someone's always thinkin' of you
Oh and how does it feel to know that someone puts no one above you
How does it feel to know that someone loves you, someone loves you
I have come to know and love you
Like I've never known or loved another
Words have not been made
That could describe these feelings
We have for each other
And I would go to any length
To let you know at all times how I care
'Cause I want you to know
That any time you reach for me you'll find me there
Repeat Chorus
Someone loves you, how does it feel to know it
Someone loves you, how does it feel to know
That someone loves you, someone loves you, how does it feel, how does it feel
How does it feel to know that someone loves you
Somebody loves you, how does it feel, how does it feel
How does it feel to know that someone loves you
Someone loves you, somebody loves you
Somebody loves you, how does it feel to know it
Somebody loves you"
576,Hungry Again,Dolly Parton,"The thrill, the desire, the excitement is gone
We seem to have found a safe comfort zone
We worked so hard to get where we are
That romance got lost on the way
It used to be never enough
We'd melt with each look and each burning touch
We laughed and we loved and we just ate it up
Back when we were hungry that way
Chorus:
Let's love like we're hungry again
Bring back the passion we had back then
The time has gone by, we forgot what it meant
Lets love like we're hungry again
Don't you miss those feelings we had at the start
And that fire that got started from each little spark
Oh it's good where we are, but I miss where we've been
Lets love like we're hungry again, now and then
Lets love like we're hungry again
Bring back the passion we had back then
The time has gone by, now we've grown too content
Lets love like we're hungry again, now and then
Lets love like we're hungry again"
577,Hushabye Hard Times,Dolly Parton,"Many years you have lingered around my cabin door
Oh hard times come again no more
Oh hard times come again no more
Oh hush a bye hard times, go ye away
Cause my hungry baby wants a Gingerbread Cake
Not a cow in the barn yard no money to spend
Not an egg in the hayloft, no little red hen
Chorus:
So, hush a bye baby don't cry no more
Your mama can't give you what you're crying for
There's a wolf at the door with an angry
Cold hungry stare, he keeps howling of hard times
And the cupboard is bare
Oh, hush a bye hard times go ye to rest
Cause my ragged baby wants a new ruffled dress
And she wants some new shoes with buckles to wear
And she wants some silver bows for her golden hair
Repeat Chorus Twice
Hush a bye hard times go ye away
I don't intend to be treated this way
So, hush a bye baby
Hush a bye hard times
Hush a bye baby
Don't cry no more
Hush a bye hard times
Hush a bye baby
Hush a bye hard times
Come ye no more
Fade:
Many years you have lingered around my cabin door
Hush a bye hard times
Come ye no more
Hush a bye baby
Hush a bye hard times
Hush a bye baby
Don't cry no more
Hush a bye hard times
Hush a bye baby
Hush a bye hard times
Come ye no more"
578,I Am Always Waiting,Dolly Parton,"From the start I promised you that I would always be
Waiting here at anytime you ever needed me
I loved you then and I love you now as I always will
And I am always waiting willing to forgive
I'll be your shelter from the storm
My love will keep you safe and warm
I'm a harbor on your stormy sea you can always come to me
For I am always waiting
My arms are always open wide and I will dry the tears you cried
If you should ever need someone darling let it be me
I will mend your broken heart and I'll replace the missing parts
I am always waiting anytime you need me
I'll be your shelter from the storm...
For I am always waiting"
579,I Believe,Dolly Parton,"I believe for every drop of rain that falls, a flower grows
And I believe that somewhere in the darkest night a candle glows
I believe for everyone who goes astray
Someone will come to show the way
Yes I believe, Oh I believe
I believe above the storm the smallest prayer will still be heard
I believe that someone in the great somewhere hears every word
Every time I hear a newborn baby cry
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know why I believe
Every time I hear a newborn baby cry
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know why I believe
I believe
Oh I believe"

581,I Can,Dolly Parton,"I can lose myself in the beauty of a song
I can climb to the top of a cloud in the sky
I can soar through the heavens like a graceful eagle
I can swing from the wings of a butterfly
I can chase the wind down the canyons of my mind
I can catch it in the corner of my memory
I can make it breathe a breath of life into an old love that has died
And I can stand and reminisce a while
In my mind I can be anything I want to be
In my mind I can do anything I want to do
Except make my mind forget you
I can take a journey to the end of the rainbow
I can go there and back and never leave my room
I can change a heartache into a tiny snowflake
And I can take December and turn it into June
In my mind I can be anything I want to be..."
582,I Cant Be True,Dolly Parton,"I can't be true no matter what I do
It's a weakness of mine, nothin' to do with you
So don't expect it of me though I expect it of you
I love you, I do, but I can't be true
Men are my weakness I've got a roving eye
And I've fallen victim to many a smile
I just love the excitement of love when it's new
I'm just a hopeless romantic so I can't be true, I can't be true
I can't be true no matter what I do
It's a weakness of mine, nothin' to do with you
So don't expect it of me though I expect it of you
I love you, I do, but I can't be true, I can't be true
Some play it safe while some like it hot
I guess you could say I never knew when to stop
But when I'm lovin' you, I'll give it all that I got
It might be different with you to know I can't be true
I can't be true no matter what I do
Oh I get around, and I break all of the rules
Now that you know it's true, I'll leave the rest up to you
I'll be good to you, but I can't be true, I can't be true
I can't be true no matter what I do
It's a weakness of mine, its not a weakness in you
So don't expect it of me though I expect it of you
I really love you, I do, but I can't be true, I can't be true
I can't be true no matter what I do
Oh I get around, and I break all of the rules

You know that I love you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else
In and out my life
You come and you go
Leaving just your picture behind
And I've kissed it a thousand times
When you snap your fingers or wink your eye
I come a running to you
Tied to you like a ball-and-chain
And there's nothing that I can do
Can't help myself
No, I can't help myself
Sugar pie, honey bunch
I'm weaker than a girl should be
I can't help myself
I'm a fool in love you see
I wanna tell you I don't love you
Tell you that we're through
And I've tried
But every time I see your face
I get all choked up inside
When I call your name
Boy it starts the flame
Burning in my heart
Tearin' it all apart
No matter how I try
My love I cannot hide
Sugar pie, honey bunch
You now that I'm weak for you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else
Ooh sugar pie honey bunch
I'll do anything you ask me to

584,I Couldnt Wait Forever,Dolly Parton,"I couldn't wait forever
Did you expect me to
I guess you thought I'd never
Find somebody new
I lived on dreams and promises
As long as I could
I couldn't wait forever
The way you thought I would
The lonely nights grew longer
As I prayed for time to fly
I lived on hopes that you'd return
And that's how I got by
The agony of loneliness
Just got too much for me
I couldn't wait forever
Needing love so desperately
So I found new lips to kiss me
New arms to hold me tight
I found new love and happiness
To fill these empty nights
You took my love for granted
Now my heart has found a new home
I couldn't wait forever
Forever's just too long
I couldn't wait forever
Forever's just too long"
585,I Dont Believe Youre Met My Baby,Dolly Parton,"Last night, my tears they were fallin'
I went to bed so sad and blue
Then I had a dream of you
I dreamed I was strollin' in the evenin'
Underneath the harvest moon
I was thinkin' about you
And then you met me in the moonlight
The stars were shining in your eyes
But another was there too
I don't believe you've met my baby
You looked at her, you looked at me
I wondered who you were talkin' to
I shook the hand of your stranger
But I was shaking more inside
Cause I was still wonderin' who
Your arm was restin' on her shoulder
You smiled at her, she smiled at you
Her eyes were filled with victory
She said my brother wants to marry
And then my heart was filled with ease
I knew that you would marry me
Oh, I don't believe you've met my baby
You looked at her, you looked at me
I knew that you would marry me
I don't believe you've met my baby"

587,I Dont Trust Me Around You,Dolly Parton,"Writer Bill Owens
Copyright 1967
You're standing much too close to me again
I've never once touched you but in my mind I've already sinned
You're making it hard for me to be true I don't trust me around you
Seems like every place I go I'll see you there
I can't keep my eyes off you I just stand and stare
You tempt me more than anyone I ever knew I don't trust me around you
I don't trust me around you I belong to someone else not once have I been untrue
But when I'm close to you this way I find myself want it to
I don't trust me around you
I don't trust me...
No I don't trust me around you"
588,I Dont Wanna Throw Rice,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton/Bill Owens)
She married the one I love today 
When my back was turned she took him away 
Now while they're all outside, waiting to throw rice 
What I want to throw will surely black her eyes 
'Cause I don't want to throw rice 
I want to throw rocks at her 
She took the only love I had 
No, I don't want to throw rice 
I want to throw rocks at her 
It would be a way to hurt her 'cause she hurt me so bad 
Well I never stole nothin' in my life 
But if I get the chance I'll steal him from his wife 
'Cause all is fair in love and war, maybe I'm carryin' this too far 
But I feel like tying dynamite to her side of the car 
No I don't want to throw rice 
I want to throw rocks at her 
She took the only love I had 
No, I don't want to throw rice 
I want to throw rocks at her 
It would be a way to hurt her 'cause she hurt me so bad"
589,I Dont Want To Throw Rice,Dolly Parton,"She married the one I love today
When my back was turned she took him away
Now while they're all outside, waiting to throw rice
What I want to throw will surely black her eyes
'cause I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
She took the only love I had
No, I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
It would be a way to hurt her 'cause she hurt me so bad
Well I never stole nothin' in my life
But if I get the chance I'll steal him from his wife
'cause all is fair in love and war, maybe I'm carryin' this too far
But I feel like tying dynamite to her side of the car
No I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
She took the only love I had
No, I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
It would be a way to hurt her 'cause she hurt me so bad"
590,I Dont Want You Around Me Anymore,Dolly Parton,"Writers Dolly Parton, Bill Owens
Copyright 1967
You think you're so smart you think I should throw my heart
Down at your feet every time that you walk by
But I I've got news for you cause I don't care for you
And I don't care honey if you love me or not
If you were half as smart as you think you are
The world would be a standin' at your door
But I I won't be there cause I no longer care
And I don't want you around me anymore
Because you can't have your way you tell me everyday
I should grow up stop acting like a child
But I I think it's you that's got some growing to do
And honey I think it's gonna take you quite a while
If you were half as smart..."
591,I Feel The Blues Movin In,Dolly Parton,"(Dell McCoury)
Though the miles are between us
I thought our love would strengthen
As it has so many times before
But something has happened
I can see it in your eyes
I can feel my world is crumblin'
And the blues are at my door
The last letter that you wrote was
On a blue piece of paper
That old feelin's back
The clouds are movin' in
The beginning of the end is near
I feel your love has faded into darkness
It seems I have no friend
I feel the blues movin' in
Oh it's not the words you wrote that made me sad
And broken-hearted
That's put me in this sad shape I'm in

Between the lines are mixed emotions
And there's teardrops on the paper
You said that's all I'll write today
I'll cose for now old friend
The last letter that you wrote was
On a blue piece of paper
That old feelin's back
The clouds are movin' in
My state of mind is desperate
And this hole that I'm sinkin' in
Gets deeper while I'm diggin' to get out
Oh please give the right answer to the questions I'm askin'
Tell me you still love me
That would turn my world about
The last letter that you wrote was
On a blue piece of paper
That old feelin's back
The clouds are movin' in"
592,I Get A Kick Out Of You,Dolly Parton,"
I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true?
That I get a kick out of you
Some people go for cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
Still I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you
Standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously don't adore me, aww

I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
Still I get a kick out of you
Yes I get a kick out of you"
593,I Hope Youre Never Happy,Dolly Parton,"I wish you all the luck I wish you only the best
Satisfaction in love, and true happiness
I wish you blue skies and rainbows, I wish you joy pure and sweet
I wish you all that you wish for, but only if you're with me
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I wish you nothin' but trouble if you've decided to leave
I'm just not like those heroes found in books and on TV
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I have had you too long, I have given too much
I have loved you too strong to think of giving you up
I've always envied those lovers that wish you well when you leave
And wish you luck with another; but there are others like me
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
And every face you look into, I hope you're haunted by me
Yes, I'm possessive and jealous; at least I speak honestly
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I'm just not like those heroes found in books and on TV
I hope you're never happy, never ever ever happy
Never ever ever happy
With anybody but me
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I wish you nothin' but trouble if you've decided to leave
I'm just not like those heroes found in books and on TV
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I hope you're never happy
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I hope you're never happy"
594,I Just Might,Dolly Parton,"What to do and where to start?
Things are falling all apart
Trying hard to move ahead
But keep losing ground instead
Still I have to take a chance
Putting fear and doubt aside
Had no warning in advance
Nothing left to do but try

And I just might make it work
I just might make it after all
I just might rise above the hurt
Thought I've suffered quite a fall
But I have to get a grip
And hold on to it like a vice
Have to face the falling chips
I just might make it, I just might
Oh, I might have been a fool
But its true that love is blind
And you have broken every rule
You've taken all that yours and mine
And How does one go on with life?
When your shattered so inside
Pieces of a love gone wrong
Well, ya pick'em up and you move along

But I just might make it work
I just might make it after all
I just might rise above the hurt
Thought I've suffered quite a fall
I just might live to see the day
I can say ""hey I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright""
I better go on either way
Rise above it, I just might be stronger then I know
Well, I might even be surprised
I've got to get on with my life
I just might make it
I just might
Nothin left to do but try
I might make it
I just might"

600,I Remember,Dolly Parton,"I remember, I remember
I remember momma and daddy most of all
I remember meadows and fields of golden wheat
I remember song birds and sugar cane so sweet
I remember lots of things that often I recall
But I remember momma and daddy most of all
I remember ginger bread my momma used to bake
I remember home-made toys that Daddy used to make
Yes, I remember many things that often I recall
But I remember momma and daddy most of all
I remember momma and daddy most of all
In our little country home they filled with love
I remember momma and daddy most of all
And all the things they did to make life happier for us
Yes I remember lots of things that often I recall
But I remember momma and daddy most of all
I remember candy that daddy used to bring
I remember songs my momma used to sing
Oh I Remember many things that often I recall
But I remember momma and daddy most of all
I remember momma and daddy most of all
And how they taught us children right from wrong
I remember momma and daddy most of all
How they used to hope and pray they'd live to see us grown

601,I Still Lost You,Dolly Parton,"Nothing new, nothing different, nothing better, nothing more
Nothing else to give you I didn't give before
I gave my love completely, my heart was always yours
It wouldn't do, I still lost you
You want to give it one chance; Don't know why we should
We'd never get that far again or make the love that good
We had our chance, we blew it; And I'll never understand
Careless fools, I still lost you
You want to fan the flames of love, stir up passion's fire
Conjure up familiar lusts, stir up past desires
What we had then, we don't have now; And I would just compare
I refuse, I still lost you
Too late for starting over, it hardly ever works
Too many missing pieces, too much water, too much hurt
I already lost you once, and that makes matters worse
What's the use, I still lost you
Oh you want to fan the flames of love, stir up passion's fire
Conjure up familiar lusts, stir up past desires
What we had then, we don't have now; And I would just compare
I refuse, I still lost you
Oh what's the use, I still lost you
I lost you"
602,I Still Miss Someone,Dolly Parton,"At my door the leaves are fallin'
A cold wild wind will come
Sweet hearts walked by together
And I still miss someone
I go out to a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
Cause I still miss someone
Chorus:
Oh I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
Repeat Chorus
And I wonder if he's sorry
For leaving what we begun
Guess there's someone for me somewhere
Aw, but I still miss somone"
603,I Took Him For Granted,Dolly Parton,"I once was blind
But now I see
I took him for granted
She took him from me
I once had a love
But now now I have none
And I'm, I'm as blue as can be
I treated him a-wrong
And now I'm, I'm all alone
I took him for granted
She took him from me
Well if I had known then
Just what I know now
I would've treated him so differently
And if I, if I had known
Well then I
I could've shown him more love
Than he'll ever see from her
I thought I had his love
In the palm of my hand
But I, I guess she showed me
And now I, I understand
Just how she, she got my man
I took him for granted
She took him from me"
604,I Walk The Line,Dolly Parton,"I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the ties that bind
Because you're mine I walk the line
I find it very very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day's through
Yes I admit it, I am a fool for you
Because you're mine I walk the line
As sure as night is dark and day's light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk that line
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Because you're mine, I walk the line
I'm gonna walk it
I'm gonna walk the line
I'm gonna walk it, walk it, walk it
I'm gonna walk that line
I'm gonna walk it because you're mine
I'm gonna walk it, walk it
I'm gonna walk the line
I'm gonna walk it, walk it
I'm gonna walk the line
I'm gonna walk it
I'm gonna walk the line"
605,I Wanna Fall In Love,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
A different lover ev'ry day
Same old book just a diff'rent page
Same old lines in the same old play
I've got to find somebody I can love all the way
I wanna fall in love, someone that I can live with
I wanna fall in love, someone to take and give with
I wanna fall in love, someone I can be real with
I wanna fall in love
I want someone to be just mine
Someone to be with all the time
A real true love is hard to find
And I don't know where I'll find him

But I've got to keep on tryin' cause
I wanna fall in love, if you hear me, listen to me
I wanna fall in love, I'm undone so come and do me
I wanna fall in love, if you got love, give it to me
Love, I wanna fall in love, someone to really need me
I wanna fall in love, someone to really please me
I wanna fall in love, when it hurts, someone to ease me
I wanna fall in love
I wanna fall in love, someone to spend my life with
I wanna fall in love, someone to fuss and fight with
I wanna fall in love, someone to make it right with
I wanna fall in love"
606,I Wanna Go Back There,Dolly Parton,"There's a place in my mind that's suspended in time
When we were happy in love
Days warm and sweet, and the night so complete
Then life was perfect for us
It was just you and I, only love in our eyes
Not a sign of a tear on our face
No sorrow, no pain, only sunshine, no rain
Before something else took its place
Oh, I wanna go back there
Back to the time there was no doubt you cared
Back to the time love was tender and fair
I wanna go back there, I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there
Do you think if we tried we could put life aside
And see if we might make it back
I know in my heart what we had at the start
I believe it could still be like that
Oh, I wanna go back there
Away from these heartaches, these worried and cares
Back to the time love was tender and fair
I wanna go back there, I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there (say you care)
I wanna go back, I wanna go back
I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there, I wanna go back there"
607,I Want To Be What You Need,Dolly Parton,"When you're not strong and need someone to lean on
Let me be your strength when you're weak
When you need somebody to comfort and love you
Let mine be the arms that you seek
I want to be what you need
Whatever it is, come to me
You'll always know where I'll be
'Cause I want to be what you need
When life gets to be more than you can endure
My hand is always in reach
And I'm always waiting, and I'm always willing
To give you whatever you need
I want to be what you need
Whatever it is, come to me
You'll always know where I'll be
'Cause I want to be what you need
Yes, I want to be what you need"
608,I Washed My Face In The Morning Den,Dolly Parton,"Duet with Porter Wagoner
Writer Tom T. Hall
Copyright 1967
The first strange town I was ever in the county was hangin' a man
And nobody cared if he lived or he died and I just didn't understand
So I washed my face in the morning dew bathed my soul in the sun
Washed my face in the morning dew and kept on moving along
The second strange town I was in they were laughing at a poor crippled man
Begging for nickels and dimes on the street and I just didn't understand
So I washed my face...
The third strange town that I was in was settled peaceful and nice
The rich got richer and the poor got poorer and to me it didn't seem right
So I washed my face...
Now someday times are bound to change it can't be very far
And each injustice that I have seen will come before the bar
Then I'll wash my face in the morning dew bathe my soul in the sun
Wash my face in the morning dew and my journey will be done"

610,I Wasted My Tears,Dolly Parton,"I wasted my tears
When I cried over you
I wasted my tears
When I cried over you
I should've known
You would never be true
I loved and I lost you
Now I'm so blue
I wasted my tears
(Wasted my tears)
When I cried over you
You said that you loved me
(You said that you loved me)
And you would be true

Oh, why did you leave me
For somebody new

When I spent it with you

When love is so new

Have come true
I wasted my tears

When I cried over you
I wasted my tears
When I cried over you"
611,I Will Always Love You,Dolly Parton,"If I should stay
Well, I would only be in your way
And so I'll go, and yet I know
That I'll think of you each step of my way
And I will always love you
I will always love you
Bitter-sweet memories
That's all I have, and all I'm taking with me
Good-bye, oh, please don't cry

What you need

I will always love you
And I hope life, will treat you kind
And I hope that you have all

612,I Will Forever Hate Roses,Dolly Parton,"I used to love it when roses would come. 
The card always read, ""You're my number 1"". 
But love never goes the way one supposes, 
And I will forever hate roses. 
You sent me roses, I thought it was nice. 
Opened the card and it read, ""goodbye"". 
You're movin' on as this chapter closes, 
And I will forever hate roses. 
I'll never see a rose from now on 
That will not remind me that you're really gone. 
Don't trust the rose for the danger it poses 
I will forever hate roses. 
The fragrance of roses will last throughout time. 
Their beauty will linger, but not in my mind. 
No, I'll love the daisies, the tulips, the posies, 
But I will forever hate roses. 
And I'll never see a rose from now own 
That will not remind me that you're really gone. 
Oh, and don't trust the rose for the pain it imposes. 
I will forever hate roses. 
Now you're movin' on as this chapter closes, 
And I will forever hate roses. 
Yes, I will forever hate roses."

My restles heart
Would never want to roam
I've never been loved
The way you love me
Chorus:
I wish I felt this way at home
When you kiss me
It's words without speaking
And I don't believe that
God would call this wrong
Your arms are the refuge
I was seeking
Repeat Chorus
But I don't, and I won't
We did all that we could
He and I
We tried hard
But it's just no good

But I'll say one more time
As I'm leavin'
Repeat Chorus
Yes, I wish I felt this way at home"

Wonderin' if I'm wrong or right
I dream about you though you've left me
I wonder where you are tonight
Chorus:
The rain is cold and slowly fallin'
Upon my window pane tonight
And though you're love was even colder
I wonder where you are tonight
It's spring, the birds are gaily singing
The trees are blossoming so sweet
No other love was quite so happy
No other love was so complete
Repeat Chorus
Then came the dawn the day you left me
I tried to smile with all my might
But you could see the pain within me
It still lingers in my heart tonight
Oh, the rain is cold and slowly fallin'
Upon my window pane tonight
And though you're love is even colder
I wonder where you are tonight"

If only in my dreams
Yes I'll be home I'll be home for Christmas"
616,Ill Make Your Bed,Dolly Parton,"I'm not the kind of girl that married dear dad
I don't bake apple pies and cookies from scratch
I'm not even handy with a needle or thread
But you'll never go hungry and I'll make your bed
I'll make your bed a place you can't wait to go
Softer than feathers and as sweet as a rose
Smooth satin pillows I will fluff for your head
And you'll want for nothin' and I'll make your bed
I'll love you to sleep at night, wake you with a kiss
Things that I can't do, I swear you won't miss
I promised forever on the day that we meet
That's love you truly and
I'll make your bed

Do-do-do-do-do-do, de-de-de-oh-h
I'll love you truly and I'll make your bed
I'll clothe you in dreams or I will feed you with love
Show you a magic life that few have dreamed of
I know this can be the love you'll never regret
'Cause I'm your forever and I'll make your bed
I'll make your bed a place you can't wait to go
Softer than feathers and as sweet as a rose
Smooth satin pillows I will fluff for your head

617,Ill Never Forget,Dolly Parton,"Sweeter than honey, as soft as a sigh
Gentle as snowflakes but warm as July
This is the way I remember your kiss
If I live forever, I'll never forget
Misty as morning, as blue as the sky
Reflections of Heaven in your loving eyes
Eyes that said more than your words ever did
And if I live forever, I'll never forget
If I live forever, I'll never forget
It's you that I'm wanting to spend my life with
Do I still love you? The answer is yes.
And if I live forever, I'll never forget
Two loving arms that I felt welcomin'
Arms that I've run to again and again
How do you erase sweet memories you miss
If I live forever, I'll never forget
Sad circumstances that stood between us
Wouldn't let us share our precious, sweet love
Do you remember, do you feel like this?
If I live forever, I'll never forget
If I live forever, I'll never forget
It's you that I wanted to share my life with
Do I still love you? The answer is yes.
And if I live forever, I'll never forget
Do you remember, do you feel like this?
If I live forever, I'll never forget"
618,Ill Never Say Goodbye,Dolly Parton,"I couldn't believe it the day that you left
Cleaned out your closet cleared off your shelves
Loaded your car and you drove out of sight
But I never said goodbye
I'll never say goodbye the door's always open I leave on a light
I'm always waiting in case you drop by I'll never say goodbye
People have told me you have a new love
My heart's not willing to give up on us
I've convinced myself they're just telling me lies
And I'll never say goodbye
I'll never say goodbye the door's always open I leave on a light
I never wanted you out of my life and I'll never say goodbye

I'll never say goodbye the door's always open I leave on a light
I'll be loving you till the day that I die and I'll never say goodbye
If you'll just come back I won't even ask why
I'll never say goodbye no I'll never say goodbye"
619,Ill Remember You As Mine,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
(I'll remember you forever I'll remember you as mine.)
Let's pretend tonight that it's the same as always
Let's go back just the little ways in time
Let's fill this one last night with lasting mem'ries
Let me remeber you as mine.
Hold me close pretending it's still me and you love
And let me be the only thought that's on your mind
Let's pretend that you don't really have a new love
Oh no let me remember you as mine.
I'll remember you as sunshine that gave lights in my world
I'll remember you as gentle as this night
I'll remember you as heaven that let me hold a little while
I'll remember you whether I'll remember you as mine.
When you leave my arms then I will be alone love
Hold me close love me gently one last time
I won't ever picture you with no one else love
No I'll remember you as mine.
I'll remember you as sunshine that gave lights in my world
I'll remember you as gentle as this night
I'll remember you as heaven that let me hold a little while
I'll remember you whether I'll remember you as mine.
As mine, as mine..."
620,Im A Drifter,Dolly Parton,"I'm a drifter, a driftin' drifter
Got no place to call my home no more
I'm a wanderer, a wandering wanderer
Got no one to call my own no more
Got no strings to tie me down
Got no cause to hang around
What difference does it make which way I go
Got an empty feelin' down inside
Still I need to stay alive
And who can tell what waits beyond this road
I'm a drifter, a driftin' drifter
Got no one to call my own no more
Got no strings to tie me down
Got no cause to hang around
What difference does it make which way I go
Got an empty feelin' deep inside
Still I need to stay alive
Who can tell what waits beyond this road
I'm a drifter, a driftin' drifter
Got no one to call my own no more
Tag:
Got no place to call my home no more"
621,Im Doing This For Your Sake,Dolly Parton,"Somone else's arms will hold you
My darling baby girl
I'll never get to see the child
I brought into this world
Because I made one mistake
Folks say that I'm bad
But they just don't understand
The way I loved your Dad
Now I thought your Daddy loved me
I was so sure he did
And so I gave him all my love
And he said, we would wed
But I guess he must have changed his mind
'Cause he left town one day
When he found out about you
He just up and ran away
In this home so far away from home
I leave my heart today
'Cause home is where the heart is
And with you, my heart will stay
Because I love you so much
Why, I can't make you pay
So I'm doing this for your sake
I'm giving you away"
622,Im Fed Up With You,Dolly Parton,"I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line
You say that wasn't you I saw with someone else last night
You say you've never done me wrong you've always treated me right
I know it was dark but not that dark and I'm not that blind
And I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line
I'm fed up with you and the way that you do
I used to love you now I change my mind
And I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line
I once believed everything you've said I was so in love with you
You said I was the only one now I know that wasn't true
Now I know just where I stand I'm tidin' your cheatin' line
And I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line
I'm fed up with you...
I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line"
623,Im Gonna Sleep With One Eye Open,Dolly Parton,"I just found out today
The little game you play
While I been sleepin' all my life away
You been steppin' so they say
Between midnight and day
So I'm gonna sleep with one eye open from now on
Chorus:
From now on, all night long
You won't have a chance
To treat your momma wrong
You been steppin' so they say
Between midnight and day
So I'm gonna sleep with one eye open from now on
There's a honky-tonk down the road
Just about a mile or so
And I understand that's where you spend your time
Baby, I got news for you
Your little game is through
Yeah, from now on baby
You better tow the line
Repeat Chorus
You thought you were bein' smart
Breaking my little heart
And leavin' me to spend my time alone

From now on, all night long
You won't have a chance
To treat your momma wrong
You been steppin' so they say
Between midnight and day
But you better sleep with one eye open from now on
Yeah an' I'm gonna sleep with eye open from now on"
624,Im In No Condition,Dolly Parton,"Don't look at me with love in your eyes
Go look at somebody that can make it worthwhile
I'm hurt from a love affair I didn't want in
I'm in no condition to try to love again
Don't smile at me because it's no use
'Cause I don't have a smile that I can give to you
Someday, you might look me up, but let me be till then
For I'm in no condition to try to love again
I'm in no condition to try to love again
Man I love just broke my heart
And it must have time to mend
He have me the breeze
Now he's gone with the wind
I'm in no condition to try to love again
I'm in no condition to try to love again
Man I love just broke my heart
And it must have time to mend
He have me the breeze
Now he's gone with the wind
I'm in no condition to try to love again
No, I'm in no condition to try to love again"
625,Im Just Leaving,Dolly Parton,"I ain't got no business here
You have made it very clear
So I'm leaving
Leaving this old town
My wings are kinda broken up
But I think I might can patch 'em up
Heaven help me
Lord, you got an angel down
Time and only time can tell
If I'm to find Heaven or Hell
Then I'm leaving
I'm just leaving
I have given all I can
I've tried but you don't understand
So I'm leaving
I'm talking big for someone so small
I know I'll be alright out there
Even so, I'm just a little scared
But that's strictly just between us
And that's all
I'm gonna be alright
I'm going to Paradise
I'm leaving
Just leaving
Time and only time can tell
If I'm to find Heaven or Hell
But I'm leaving
I'm just leaving
My wings are kinda broken up

626,Im Not Worth The Tears,Dolly Parton,"Mama didn't always have those tears in her eyes
And daddy once was able to hold his head up high
But now I brought disgrace to my whole family
Now they cry, but I'm not worth
The tears they cry for me
I loved a boy and then I found that he just lead me on
So in my hurt and bitterness
I let myself go alone
But all I did was hurt myself
And shame my family
And now they cry but I'm not worth
The tears they cry for me
No I'm not worth
The salt in one tiny tear
Oh why have I brought shame
To the one I loved so dear
I'm so sorry that I hurt them
But they'll never know how sorry
And now they cry but I'm not worth
The tears they cry for me
Yes now they cry, but I'm not worth
The tears they cry for me"
627,Im Sixteen,Dolly Parton,"I'm sixteen burstin' at the seams
I'm back in my teens
Caution to the wind, yeah
You love me and what could be
More rejuvenating, I am young again
I'm sixteen, I'm sixteen
Loving you's a dream
And life is a breeze
Kickin' up my heels
Haven't had such thrills
Since I was sixteen cruisin' round the Tasty Freeze
It goes to show you're never old
Unless you choose to be
And I will be sixteen forever
Just as long as you love me
Baby, we can go to the drive-in show
Drinking Cherry Coke and Concession Trees
And maybe kiss and hug
Doing all that stuff
Always leading up
To that old back seat
I'm sixteen, yeah
I'm sixteen, yeah
We're in love
Oh, happy days
You and me, we are wild and free
We'll go steady until your daddy takes the T-bird away
It goes to show you're never old
Unless you choose to be
And I will be sixteen forever
Just as long as you love me
Watch me
You and I take a little dive
In the mill pond after midnight in our birthday suit
Makin' sweet, sweet love
Meet the stars above
Sneakin' back in through the window
'Fore the clock strikes two, yeah
I'm sixteen, burstin' at the seams
I'm back in my jeans
And I feel no pain
Kickin' up my heels
Haven't had such thrills
Since drivin' my old Chevy down Lovers' Lane
It goes to show you're never old
Unless you choose to be
And I will be sixteen forever
Just as long as you love me
Yeah, I'm sixteen, yeah
I'm sixteen, yeah
I'm sixteen, yeah
Caution to the wind
I'm sixteen, I'm sixteen
I'm sixteen, I feel young again
I'm sixteen
Don't I look sixteen?
You don't have to say
But I feel sixteen"
628,Im Thinking Tonight Of My Blue Eyes,Dolly Parton,"Oh I'm thinking tonight of my blues eyes
Who is sailing all over the sea
And I'm thinking tonight of him only
And I wonder does he ever think of me
Could been better for us both had we never
In this wide wicked world had never met
For the pain and the pleasures he's brought me
I am sure I will never forget
So I'm thinking tonight of my blues eyes...
Oh you told me once dear that you love me
And you swore that we never would part
But a linking the chain has been broken
Leaving me with a sad broken heart
Yes I'm thinking tonight of my blues eyes
And I wonder does he ever think of me"
629,Im Wasting Your Time And Youre Wasting Mine,Dolly Parton,"There's nothing left to tie us to each other anymore
The love we knew is gone and that's a fact we can't ignore
There's nothing left to loose ends on all the ties that bind
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
There's no use in wasting the good years that we have left
When we might find happiness with somebody else
There's no chance for us we can see it we're not blind
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
The blame belongs to both of us I guess we didn't try
Love is like a garden without care we let it die
The flower of love can't bloom if the sun don't ever shine
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine

The blame belongs to both of us...
Though it hurts we know we must leave it all behind
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
You're wasting mine you're wasting mine"
630,Ive Been Married Just As Long As You Have,Dolly Parton,"Last night you went out again with what you said was your best friend
You say you need some time away from me
The sun was high when you got in but not as high as you had been
And I wonder how you would act if I done just the way I pleased
I've been married just as long as you have
And I get tired of the same old things just the same as you have
Well let me tell you this big boy when you go out for a night of joy
You better start taking me along or you'll be singing a different song
For I've been married just as long as you have
While I'm working hard all day you run around and spend my pay
You entertain your friends at my expence
But you cry and carry on when I do something on my own
And you accuse with lack of evidence
I've been married just as long as you have
And I get tired of the same old things just the same as you have
So let me tell you this sweetheart I figure I've done my part
So don't get cute and get so smart I'll tell you this before you start
I've been married just as long as you have"
631,Ive Been This Way Too Long,Dolly Parton,"Hmm (oh ain't he cute)
Ah well I don't like to get up if I feel like sleeping
No and I don't like to sweep my floor if I don't feel like sweeping
If you don't like the way I am then you can move along
You can't change the way I am I've been this way too long
I've been this way too long and you can't ever change me now
Don't waste your time in tryin' cause I am just what I am
I've got my way of doin' things and who can say I'm wrong
You can't change the way I am I've been this way too long
Oh and I don't like to make my bed if I don't feel like makin' it
No and I don't like to bake no bread if I don't feel like bakin' it
If you don't like the way I am then you can move along
Cause you can't change the way I am I've been this way too long
Well I don't like to hoe no corn if I don't feel like hoein' it
(You should you're corny)
And I don't like to mow no grass if I don't feel like mowin' it
(I know it's comin' through the upstairs window)
If you don't like the way I am then you can move along
You can't change the way I am I've been this way too long
If you don't like the way I am...
Oh as far as I can remember back you have been this way
(And as long as you remember I will be honey)
When you was in the first grade you was exact the same way
(First grade I was waitin' for the second)
You swiped the pencils and scattered paper all over the desk
(Oh that's real cute you're makin' up stuff)"
632,Ive Had Enough,Dolly Parton,"Love it's not I who didn't try
Hard enough, hard enough
And this is why I'm saying goodbye
I've had enough, I've had enough
Love you don't see
The pain in me
That's plain enough, plain enough
You're never here to catch the tears
I cried for us, I cried for us
I'll take my share but I'll be fair
There's not much stuff
Easy enough
And if you choose I'll break the news
This part is tough, so very tough
I've tried and tried to put aside
The time to talk, but without luck
So I'll just pin this note within your coat
And leave the garden gate unlocked
And this is why I'm saying goodbye
I've had enough, I've had enough"
633,Ive Lived My Life,Dolly Parton,"I've lived my life and I'm only eighteen
I left the country for the city
Thought I was smart but I was silly
I should've known I'd get in trouble being so green
I've lived my life and I'm only eighteen
I met a boy and learned to love him
I would have done anything for him
I loved him more than anything I've ever seen
I've lived my life and I'm only eighteen
Only eighteen but its all over
I ruined my life to please my lover
I made him happy, he made me cry
Then said goodbye
I've lived my life and I'm only eighteen
Only eighteen but its all over
I ruined my life to please my lover
I made him happy, he made me cry
Then said goodbye
I've lived my life and I'm only eighteen
I've lived my life and I'm only eighteen"
634,If,Dolly Parton,"
If a picture paints a thousand words
Then why can't I paint you?
The words will never show
The you I've come to know
If a face could launch a thousand ships
Then where am I to go?
There's no one home but you
You're all that's left me too
And when my love for life is running dry
You come and pour yourself on me
If I could be two places at one time
I'd be with you
Tomorrow and today
Beside you all the way
If the world should stop revolving
Spinning slowly down to die
I'd spend the end with you
And when the world was through
Then one by one the stars would all go out
Then you and I would simply fly away

If a picture paints a thousand words
Then why can't I paint you?
Because the words could never show
The you I've come to know
And one by one the stars will all go out
But you and I will simply fly away
We'll fly away"
635,If I Cross Your Mind,Dolly Parton,"If I cross your mind, please let me cross it slowly
Let me stop and reminisce with you for a while
And if I cross your mind, please remember only good things
Think of me as happiness if I cross your mind
There must be a million thoughts rushing through your mind
And if there's one of me love, among them that you find
Please stop for just a little while and treat it extra kind
When you think of me love, if I cross your mind
If you must hide my memory when you're with someone else
Then make mine very special when you're by yourself
For only in a memory can one turn back the time
To lovely tender moments that linger in your mind
There must be a million thoughts rushing through your mind
And if there's one of me love, among them that you find
Won't you stop for just a little while and treat it extra kind
When you think of me love, if I cross your mind
Think of only good things if I cross your mind"
636,If I Had Wings,Dolly Parton,"If I had wings I would fly away from
All my troubles, all my thing
And I would fly to a place of comfort
Heaven knows I need a change
If I had wings, Lord give me wings
I let my share'
Walked alone, alone to road
I could have used a new tomorrow
If I had wings I'd make it so
One cannot predict the future
One cannot undo the past
But we can make the present useful
Build the future that will last
If I had wings I'd fly away from
All my troubles, all my wounds
And I would fly 'till I found freedom
If I had wings I'd up and go home
If I had wings, Lord give me wings
If I had wings I'd fly away from
All my troubles, all my wounds
And I would fly 'till I found freedom
If I had wings I'd up and go home
If I had wings, Lord give me wings
If I had wings, if I had wings
If I had wings, Oh, just give me wings
If I had wings, If had wings I'd make a change
If I had wings, if I had wings
If I had wings, if I had wings"
637,If Teardrops Were Pennies,Dolly Parton,"An acre of diamonds I'd offered to you
A solid gold mansion an airplane or two
This whole world would be yours to have and to hold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
I'd have all the riches my pockets would hold
I'd feel oh so wealthy with treasures untold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold

The tears that have fallen won't buy you a thing
The heartaches you've caused me won't pay for a ring
The love that I wanted would not have grown cold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold...
But teardrops aren't pennies and heartaches aren't gold"
638,If You Aint Got Love,Dolly Parton,"What good is wealth and fame
Fine clothes and diamond rings?
It just don't mean a thing
If you ain't got love
But you can have your cake and icing too
If you got someone to love that cares for you
'Cause love's the sweetest gift we can possess
To have true love is to be truly blessed
'Cause joy and happiness and peace of mind
It's what we all desire but seldom find
But nothing in this world can take its place
Let's fill our hearts with love, for goodness sake
'Cause what good is wealth and fame
Fine clothes and diamond rings?
It just don't mean a thing
If you ain't got love
Big homes and fancy cars
Rubbin' elbows with the stars
But it still won't get you far
If you ain't got love
If you ain't got love, if you ain't got love
Then you ain't got much, if you ain't got love
If you ain't got love, you're out of touch
You ain't got enough if you ain't got love
Show me some love now
If you ain't got love, if you ain't got love
'Cause what good is wealth and fame
Fine clothes and diamond rings
Well, it just don't mean a thing
If you ain't got love
Big homes and fancy cars
Rubbin' elbows with the stars
But that still won't get you far
If you ain't got love
'Cause if you ain't got love, if you ain't got love
Then you ain't got much if you ain't got love
'Cause if you ain't got love, you're out of touch
You ain't got enough if you ain't got love
You're out of touch, you ain't got enough if you ain't got love"
639,If You Need Me,Dolly Parton,"Intro:
If you need me, I'll be gone
The bed's still warm where you just left
But it'll be colder where I've slept
I've always been where you needed me
But I ain't the fool I used to be
You come home all hours of the night
The fragrance on you ain't old spice
Tonight when you come draggin' home
And find you need me, I'll be gone
1st Chorus:
I'll be gone like the moon when the sun comes up
Gone like the dew from the buttercup
Gone like a woman treated wrong
If you need me, I'll be gone
So, what am I still doing here?
You've been doin' me wrong for years
Tired of pickin' up and puttin' out
I'm leaving you lock, stock, and house
So, bye, bye, baby
That's it, I'm packed
I'm a'leavin' now, but I'll call back
And leave this message on the code-a-phone
Sayin', if you need me, well, I'll be gone
2nd Chorus:
I'll be gone like the moon when the sun comes up
Gone like the dew from the buttercup
Gone like a woman leavin' home
If you need me, I'll be gone

I said, if you need me, I'll be gone

640,If You Say I Can,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
When my strength is not enough to face the disapointments
When nothing seems to work out like I planned
When I think I've reached the end, just stop and reassure me
Cause I can make it, if you say I can
If you say I can, then I can find the strength to do it
In knowing you believe that much in me
Tell me that I can and give me faith in what I'm doing
I'm only just as strong as you make me
But I can do it, if you say I can
When I've reached the point of thinking life's not worth the bother
When I can't seem to give what life demands
When it seems impossible to make it any farther
I can go on, if you say I can
If you say I can, then I can find the strength to do it
In knowing you believe that much in me
Tell me that I can and give me faith in what I'm doing
I'm only just as strong as you make me
But I can do it, if you say I can"
641,Imagine,Dolly Parton,"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today...
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace...
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world...
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one"
642,In Each Love Some Pain Must Fall,Dolly Parton,"Darling it's not really over it just seems to be
Darling I don't really think that we want to be free
A raging storm of anger made us want to end it all
Darling don't you know in each love some pain must fall
These tiny drops of pain that's falling down our face
Tomorrow will be gone almost without a trace
It's hurtin' now but soon we'll find it doesn't hurt at all
Darling don't you know in each love some pain must fall
In each love some pain must fall that doesn't mean that it's the end
When the anger is all gone everything will be all right again
And the hurt that seems so big now tomorrow will seem small
Darling don't you know in each love some pain must fall

In each love some pain must fall...
Darling don't you know in each love some pain must fall"
643,In The Ghetto,Dolly Parton,"As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto
People, don't you understand
The child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way
Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto
And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
In the ghetto
Then one night in desperation
A young man breaks away
He buys a gun, steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries
As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto
As her young man dies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto"
644,In The Good Old Days,Dolly Parton,"We'd get up before sun-up to get the work done up
We'd work in the fields till the sun had gone down
We've stood and we've cried as we have bristly watched
A hailstorm a' beatin' our crops to the ground
We've gone to bed hungry many nights in the past
In the good old days when times were bad
Chorus:
No amount of money could buy from me
The memories that I have of then
No amount of money could pay me
To go back and live through it again
I've seen daddy's hands break open and bleed
And I've seen him work till he's stiff as a board
An' I've seen momma layin' in suffer and sickness
In need of a doctor we couldn't afford
Anything at all was more than we had
In the good old days when times were bad
We've got up before and found ice on the floor
Where the wind would blow snow through the cracks in the wall
And I couldn't enjoy then, havin' a boyfriend
I had nothing decent to wear at all
So I long for a love that I never had
In the good old days when times were bad
Repeat chorus

646,In The Meantime,Dolly Parton,"You know people been talking about the end of time ever since time began
We've been living in the last days ever since the first day ever since the dawn of Man
Well nobody knows when the end is coming but some people tell you they do
Well it might be today, it might be tomorrow, or in a million years or two...
In the meantime, in between time, let us make time to make it right
And let us not fear what is not clear; faith should be your guide, just follow this advice..
And...
Think about love; Think about living
Think about love sharing and giving
Drop the Doomsday attitude and let the spirit flow
These are wonderful times we're living in
God still walks in the hearts of Men
And Eden's garden waves within so let the flowers grow
Well we rant and we rave about the ""good ol' days"" and how different it was ""back then""
Well the greatest days we've ever known are the days we're living in
Well we worry about earthquakes, aliens from outer space, nuclear holocaust
Well we're so consumed with the fear of dying; the joy of living is lost
In the meantime, in between time, let us make time to make amends
Lead the good life, just treat this planet right and try to all be friends and say with me again..
Ohhh...!
Think about life; Think about living
Think about love - caring and giving
Drop this Doomsday attitude and get on with the show
We've walked on the moon; been to Mars
Technically we've come so far
But still we wonder who we are
The farther along we go
(Doodle-doodle doo-doo-doo... ooh-ooh)
You know people been talking about the end of time ever since time began
We've been living in the last days ever since the first day ever since the dawn of Man
Well nobody knows when the end is coming—well that's what the Scriptures say
But that's a secret known only to God, he says to just watch and pray
In the meantime, what's the hurry?
In the meantime now don't you worry
In the meantime live, laugh- be merry
In the meantime, in the meantime
In the meantime troubles gonna show us
In the meantime the sky is still above us
In the meantime you know God's gonna love us
In the meantime, in the meantime, in the meantime..."
647,In The Pines,Dolly Parton,"In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
My love, my love, what have I done
To make you treat me so
You've caused me to weep, you've caused me to mourn
You've caused me to leave my home
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
The longest train I ever saw
Went down that Georgia Line
The engine passed at six o'clock
The caboose went by at nine
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
I asked my captain for the time of day
He said he throwed his watch away
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
Hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo"
648,In The Presence Of You,Dolly Parton,"In the presence of you I wonder
Why I can't say the things that I want to
All the pretty words that I planned to say when I'm with you
I lose them in the presence of you
Your nearness makes my voice tremble
There's a weakness that I feel through and through
Searching for words to describe how I love you
Don't come easy in the presence of you
Love and admiration might make my words silent
But feelings say more than words do
And the feeling of loving you is all around me
Anytime I'm in the presence of you
Love and admiration might make my words silent..."
649,In The Sweet By And By,Dolly Parton,"There's a land that is fairer than day
And by faith we can see it afar
For the father waits over the way
To prepare us a dwelling place there
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
We shall sing on that beautiful shore
The melodious songs of the Blest
And our spirit shall sorrow no more
Not a sign for the blessing of rest
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
In the sweet by and by
In the sweet by and by, oh"
650,Is Forever Longer Than Always,Dolly Parton,"(by porter wagoner & frank dycus)
your trembling hands held me near
your soft warm lips whispered in my ear
you said you'd always love me
and we'd always be together
and your promised me your love would last forever
is forever longer than always?
you're gone from me ow and you have been for days why you didn't stay
unless forever is longer than always
is forever longer than always
you're gone from me now and you have been for days
and in my mind i can't fing the reason why you didn't stay
unless forever is longer than always
is forever longer than always."
651,Is It Real,Dolly Parton,"You came into my life at a time when I was down
And I thought I'd never love again but I think different now
You took my hand and helped me up and I thank you for your precious love
And words cannot express the way I feel but is it real
Is it real this love that you have offered me so freely
You tell me that you love me but darling do you really
Don't make me love and lose again don't make me go through that again
I've known that hurt and I know how it feels oh is it real
Well you could mend my broken heart with love as sweet as yours
And I want to believe it's real but how can I be sure
And you could heal the hurt I've known with the love that you have shown
And all the needs you have I will fullfill but is it real
Is it real this love that you have...
Is it real"
652,Islands In The Stream,Dolly Parton,"Baby, when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something going on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, ah ha
Making love with each other, ah ha
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha
I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you did walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby, I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever
We can ride it together, ah ha
Making love with each other, ah ha
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha
Sail away
Oh come sail away with me
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha
Islands in the stream
That is what we are"
653,It Aint Fair That It Aint Right,Dolly Parton,"It ain't fair for you to leave me cold and cryin' in the night
It ain't fair to take your body from my arms and out of sight
It ain't fair you've gone and left me where you kissed me I still burn
Are you leaving for my loving this awful hurt and then return
It ain't fair for you to leave me alone to face the morning light
It ain't fair you took my body and then to say that it ain't right
It ain't fair you've made me your woman a no longer a good girl in your eyes
How come before you said you'd love me it ain't fair that it ain't right
It just ain't fair that it ain't right"
654,It Cant Be True,Dolly Parton,"I can't be true no matter what I do
It's a weakness of mine, nothin' to do with you
So don't expect it of me though I expect it of you
I love you, I do, but I can't be true
Men are my weakness I've got a roving eye
And I've fallen victim to many a smile
I just love the excitement of love when it's new
I'm just a hopeless romantic so I can't be true, I can't be true
I can't be true no matter what I do
It's a weakness of mine, nothin' to do with you
So don't expect it of me though I expect it of you
I love you, I do, but I can't be true, I can't be true
Some play it safe while some like it hot
I guess you could say I never knew when to stop
But when I'm lovin' you, I'll give it all that I got
It might be different with you to know I can't be true
I can't be true no matter what I do
Oh I get around, and I break all of the rules
Now that you know it's true, I'll leave the rest up to you
I'll be good to you, but I can't be true, I can't be true
I can't be true no matter what I do
It's a weakness of mine, its not a weakness in you
So don't expect it of me though I expect it of you
I really love you, I do, but I can't be true, I can't be true
I can't be true no matter what I do
Oh I get around, and I break all of the rules
Now that you know it's true, I'll leave the rest up to you
I'll be good to you, but I can't be true, I can't be true"
655,It Might As Well Be Me,Dolly Parton,"Duet with Porter Wagoner
Writers Dolly Parton , Dorothy Jo Hope
Copyright 1970
I'm lookin' for a way to get out there's no hope for you and me
We'll never get along everything we do is wrong
You and I both know one of us has to go and it might as well be me
We stopped loving a long time ago and now all we do is disagree
There's no use to pretend there's no need to try again
You and I both know one of us has to go and it might as well be me
There's no use for us to live a lie
When we're just wasting the best years of our lives
We'll never get along everything we do is wrong
You and I both know one of us has to go and it might as well be me
You and I both know one of us has to go and it might as well be me"
656,It Must Be You,Dolly Parton,"Just like the tide goes with the sea
We belong together, you and me
Just like the dawn followed by day
We'll always be together
And that's just how it will stay
Chorus:
It must be you that's always walking in my dreams
It must be you who'll always be right next to me
So when you find yourself alone
Just think of me and I'll be there
Must be you by my side the whole way through
Just like the fresh white winter snow
Our love is pure and it will always grow
And when we're in those autumn years
Together, we'll look back, but we won't shed a single tear
Repeat Chorus
When you find yourself alone
Just think of me and I'll be there
Must be you by my side the whole way through"
657,It Wasnt God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels,Dolly Parton,"(Jimmy D. Miller)
Dolly Parton & Patsy Cline
As I sit here tonight the jukebox's playing
A tune about the wild side of life
As I listen to the words you are saying
It brings mem'ries when I was a trusting wife.
It wasn't god who made honky tonk angels
As you said in the words of your song
Too many times married men think they're still single
That has caused many a good girl to go wrong.
--- Instrumental ---
It's a shame that all the blame is on us women
It's not true that only you men feel the same
From the start most every heart that's ever broken
Was because there always was a man to blame.
It wasn't god who made honky tonk angels
As you said in the words of your song
Too many times married men think they're still single
That has caused many a good girl to go wrong.
That has caused many a good girl to go wrong..."
658,Its All Wrong But Its All Right,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
Hello, are you free tonight 
I like your looks, I love your smile 
Could I use you for a while, 
It's all wrong, but it's all right 
The amber sunset glow has died 
My needs are very much alive 
Is it ok if I stop by 
It's all wrong, but it's all right 
It's all wrong, but it's all right 
Just close your eyes and hold me tight 
Tell me sexy lovin' lines 
It's all wrong, but it's all right 
It may be wrong if we make love 
But I just need someone so much 
And who knows it might last for life 
It's all wrong, but it's all right 
It's all wrong, but it's all right 
Just close your eyes and hold me tight 
Tell me sexy lovin' lines 
It's all wrong, but it's all right 
It's all wrong, but it's all right

659,Its My Time,Dolly Parton,"It's my time
Gather round girls
You I grew up with
My old friends that I used to scuff with
Need you round me
At this time

660,Its Not My Affair Anymore,Dolly Parton,"I never knew what this could do
Seeing another woman with you
But I can't stay here
'Cause I would never get over you
Baby that'll never do
I gotta get loose
Somebody take me out of this place
Keep my eyes from seeing your face
'Cause you love her the way you once loved me
Darling I can't believe it's true oh no
Chorus:
It's not my affair anymore
You're not my man to care for
It's not my affair anymore
I'll close the door
So many things we've left unsaid
So many questions in my head
Well I never lock the back door
Ooh and somehow you keep slipping on in
Taking me back once again
To a memory trail like a shadow
From a feelin' and it just grows don't I know
Repeat Chorus
Remember, all of the laughter
Remember, ooh the morning after
Remember, the moonlight, the candle light, the shady light
Remember, and it seemed so right
Repeat Chorus
Remember, the moonlight, the candle light, the shady light
Remember, ooh and it seemed so right
Repeat Chorus
Fade:
It's not my affair anymore
It's not my affair anymore
It's not my affair anymore
It's not my affair anymore"
661,Its Such A Heartache,Dolly Parton,"Each time I dial your number I never get an answer
It seems like you're avoiding me
I can't take unhappy endings so I just keep pretending
You'll see the light eventually
Can't stop my heart from breaking, can't stop my hands from shaking
Can't keep my eyes from crying, can't believe your love is dying
Can't stop the rain from falling, no answer when I'm calling
My love, it's so confusing, it's such a heartache losin' you
Feels like some tragic movie please say you'll come back to me
Dreamin' of you night after night
I'm havin' trouble sleepin
Your memory is keepin' these feelings runnin' through my mind
Can't stop my heart from breaking, can't stop my hands from shaking
Can't keep my eyes from crying, can't believe your love is dying
Can't stop the rain from falling, no answer when I'm calling
My love, it's so confusing, it's such a heartache losin' you
It's such a heartache, I don't know what to do
It's such a heartache and it's tearin' me in two
You took away the dream I wanted more than anything
Can't stop my heart from breaking, can't stop my hands from shaking
Can't keep my eyes from crying, can't believe your love is dying
Can't stop the rain from falling, no answer when I'm calling
My love, it's so confusing, it's such a heartache losin' you
Can't stop my heart from breaking, can't stop my hands from shaking
Can't keep my eyes from crying, can't believe your love is dying
Can't stop the rain from falling, no answer when I'm calling

662,Its Too Late To Love Me Now,Dolly Parton,"It's too late
You say you want me, and it's too late
Once my love for you was so great
But it's too late to love me now
It's too bad
You say you need me, and it's too bad
I know the feelin' and it's so sad
But it's too late to love me now
It's too late to love me now
Don't you know how hard I tried to hold out just for you?
Lovin' you from mem'ry day by day
Then someone came into my life, turned my dreams around
He's takin' all the love you threw away
It's too late
You say you want me, and it's too late
Once my love for you was so great
But it's too late to love me now
It's too late to love me now
Don't you know how hard I tried to hold out just for you?
Lovin' you from mem'ry day by day
Then someone came into my life, turned my world around
He's takin' all the love you threw away
It's too late
You say you need me, and it's too late
Once my love for you was so great
But it's too late to love me now
It's too late to love me now"
663,Jj Sneed,Dolly Parton,"At last I have called up with you and you're a sight to see
Could this really be my outlaw lover JJ Sneed
Could a woman with a painted face and pretty sweet disguise
Turn your heart against me with her evil cunning eyes her evil cunning eyes
JJ it's been you and me right from the very start
And ever job we ever pulled I'd always done my part
We'd really stick together until the bitter end
And it was my understanding we were whole lots more than friends
A whole lot more than friends
And it was me that kept you on when nights were dark and cold
But I guess I didn't look like much in these old ragged clothes
But you said it didn't matter cause you love me that a way
You said that no one else could ever steal your heart away steal your heart away
Do you recall the Union Bank we robbed in Franklin Town
And as we made our getaway the sheriff gunned you down
And I doctored up your bullet wounds and nursed you while you sit
But now you have betrayed me is that the thanks I get is that the thanks I get
Oh yeah JJ I'm thinking now of how we'd all begun
Of all the times we've robbed and killed with our trust wordy gun
Why we stood off a fuss it was JJ just you and I
But now you have betrayed me and for that you're gonna die
Yeah for that you're gonna die
The good old days are over as we stand here in the rain
JJ I'm gonna shoot you now I hope you'll feel no pain
I hear whoopees of the horses and fieces on my trail
I guess I'll join you soon but for now JJ farewell for now JJ farewell"
664,Jealous Heart,Dolly Parton,"Mine is a jealous heart
Imagines things that never are
Builds a fire from a tiny spark
But that's the way of a jealous heart
Sunny skies and a rosy bed
Thorns and storm clouds up ahead
'Cause suddenly the sky turns dark
For those of us with a jealous heart
Imagination runnin' wild
Like a frantic frightened child
Any time that we're apart
I can't control my jealous heart
And you know mine is a jealous heart
And every hurt leaves a lasting scar
Don't you hate yourself for the fool you are
When you're cursed with a jealous heart
I love you more than words can tell
One day's heaven two days hell
Suspicious words like poison darts
Spoken from my jealous heart
Mine is a jealous heart
Imagines things that never are
Builds a fire from a tiny spark
But that's the way of a jealous heart
And you know mine, you know mine is a jealous heart
And every hurt, and every hurt leaves a lasting scar
Don't you hate yourself for the fool you are
When you're cursed with a jealous heart
And you know mine, you know mine is a jealous heart
Imagines things, imagines things that never are
Builds a fire from a tiny spark
But that's the way of a jealous heart"
665,Jeannies Afraid Of The Dark,Dolly Parton,"Her two little feet would come running into
Our bedroom almost every night
Her soft little face would be wet from her tears
And her little heart pounding with fright
She'd hold out her arms, then she'd climb in beside us
In her small voice, we'd hear her remark
""Mommie and Daddy, can I sleep here with you
'Cause Jeannie's afraid of the dark""
One day in the summer, we took some flowers
To place on some old family graves
Jeannie said, ""Mommy, ain't it dark in the ground
Oh, Daddy, I'd be so afraid""
Then she looked up at her daddy and me
And said somethin' that broke both our hearts
She said, ""When I die, please don't bury me
'Cause Jeannie's afraid of the dark""
Jeannie was always afraid of the dark
And we never could understand why
'Cause we looked after Jeannie with the very best of care
Because Jeannie was our only child
Perhaps it was death that she was so afraid of
'Cause it took her one dark stormy night
I think we always knew that we'd never see Jeannie grown
'Cause it seemed she was destined to die
But on Jeannie's grave, we placed an eternal flame
That glows and never loses its spark
And on the darkest night, there's always a light
'Cause Jeannie's afraid of the dark
Our Jeannie's afraid of the dark"
666,Jesus Gravity,Dolly Parton,"I'm to the point where it don't add up
I can't say I've come this far with my guitar on pure dumb luck
That's not to say i know it all
'Cause everytime I get too high up on my horse I fall
'Cause I've got,
Somethin' lifting me up
Somethin' holding me down
Somethin' to give me wings and
Somethin' to keep my feet on the ground
I've got all I need,
Jesus and gravity
But, I'm as bad as anyone
Taking all these blessings in my life for granted one by one
When I start to thinkin' it's all me
Well, somethin' comes along and knocks me right back on my knees
And I've got:
Somethin' lifting me up
Somethin' holding me down
Somethin' to give me wings and
Somethin' to keep my feet on the ground
I've got all i need, Jesus and gravity
He's my friend
He's my light
He's my wings
He's my flight
And I've got,
Somethin' lifting me up
Somethin' holding me down
Somethin' to give me wings and,
Somethin' to keep my feet on the ground
I've got all I'm gonna need,
I got Jesus, I got Jesus, I got:
Somethin' lifting me up
Somethin' holding me down
Somethin' to give me wings and
Somethin' to keep my feet on the ground
I've got all I'll ever need,
'Cause I got Jesus and gravity
Somethin' lifting me up
Somethin' holding me down
Somethin' to give me wings and
Somethin' to keep my feet on the ground
I've got all I'll need
'Cause I've got Jesus and gravity
Jesus, I've got Jesus, I've got Jesus
He's my everything
He lifts me up
He gives me wings
He gives me hope
And He gives me strength
And that's all I'll ever need
As long as He keeps lifting me up
He is my life
He is my God
He is my wings
He is my flight
Lift me, I've got Jesus, I've got Jesus
And that's all I need"
667,Jingle Bells,Dolly Parton,"Oh jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Hey jingle bells jingle bells...
Dashing through the snow in a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go laughing all the way
Bells on bobtail ring making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
Oh jingle bells jingle bells...

Oh jingle bells jingle bells..."
668,John Daniel,Dolly Parton,"Verse 1:
John Daniel came to town one summer afternoon
Wearin' dirty work clothes so everyone presumed
He was just another logger from the loggin' camp nearby
And he was, but there was somethin' different in John Daniel's eyes
Verse 2:
John Daniel was a young man, not more than twenty-four
And there was an air about him that one could not ignore
And in spite of callused hands & dirty clothes, his face was kind
And I wanted so to know what was in John Daniel's mind
1st Chorus:
John Daniel, tell me where did you come from; tell me where is it you've been
John Daniel, tell me why are you different from all of these other men
John Daniel, there's somethin' about you that I don't quite understand
John Daniel, do you hold the answer to a higher plan?
Verse 3:
I rented him a room; he went upstairs like all the rest
It was Saturday and he'd be goin' in to town, I guessed
But he left in a robe and sandals, with a Bible in his hand;
And I thought to myself, John Daniel, I don't understand
Verse 4:
Now I'd planned to meet some friends of mine when I got off at three,
In the park we often gather to talk of love and peace
When I got there I found that a crowd had gathered 'round;
And there I saw John Daniel a sittin' on the ground
2nd Chorus:
John Daniel, tell me where did you come from; tell me where is it you've been
John Daniel, tell me why are you different from all of these other men
John Daniel, there's somethin' about you that I don't quite understand
John Daniel, do you hold the answer to a higher plan?
Verse 5:
So, ""You want to be free,"" he said, ""Well, this is how you can.""
As he read from the Bible he held in his hand
We were searchin' for the truth not knowin' where to look,
Not knowin' that the answers all were in John Daniel's book
Verse 6:
John Daniel told us all how we could be free
John Daniel taught us all a better way for you and me
He came to us in our own way so we'd be sure to see
He had the light and essence of the man from Galilee
3rd Chorus:
John Daniel, tell me where did you come from; tell me where is it you've been
John Daniel, tell me why are you different from all of these other men
John Daniel, there's something about you that I don't quite understand
John Daniel, do you hold the answer to a higher plan?
Tag:
John Daniel, John Daniel, John Daniel
John Daniel do you hold the answer to a higher plan?
John Daniel came to town one summer afternoon
Wearin' dirty work clothes so everyone presumed
He was just another logger from the loggin' camp nearby
And he was, but there was somethin' different in John Daniel's eyes
Ooh, John Daniel, tell me where did you come from
Tell me where is it you've been
John Daniel, tell me why are you different from all of these other men
John Daniel, there's something about you that I don't quite understand
John Daniel, do you hold the answer to a higher plan?"
669,Jolene,Dolly Parton,"Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can
Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene
He talks about you in his sleep
There's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can
You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me, Jolene
I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you

672,Joshua,Dolly Parton,"Well a good way down the rail-road track,
There was this little old run down shack
And in it lived a man I'd never se-e-e-een
Folk said he was a mean and a vicious man
And you'd better not set foot on his land
But I didn't think nobody could be that mean
So I took me out walking down the rail-road track
I was gonna go down to that little old shack
An' just find out if all them things I'd heard was true
There was a big black dog laying out in the yard
And he growled at me and I swallowed hard
And I heard somebody say"" well, who are you?""
Ooh and there he stood in the door of that shack
And his beard and his hair was long and black
And he was the biggest man I ever seen
when he spoke his voice was low and deep
but he just didnt frighten me
cause somehow i just knew he wasnt mean
he said "" what yuh doing snooping round my place""
and i saw a smile come across his face
so i smiled back and i told him who i was
He said "" come on in, pull you up a chair,
You might as well since you're already here""
And he said "" you can call me joshua""
joshua joshua what you doing living here all alone
joshua joshua aint you got nobody to call your own
no no no no
we talked till the sun was clean out of sight
and we still talked when it come daylight
there was just so much we had to say
i spent my life in an orphans home
and just like him i was all alone
so i said""yeah"" when he asked if i'd stay
ooh we grew close as time went on
and that little ole shack it was a happy home
and we just couldn't help but fall in love
that big black dog and that little ole shack
sitting down by the railroad track
its plenty good enough for me and joshua
joshua joshua why your just what i've been a looking for
joshua joshua you aint gonna be lonesome anymore
oh no
""country yodelling""
me and joshua
me and joshua
me and joshua"
673,Joy To The World,Dolly Parton,"Joy to the world the Lord is come let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare him room
And heaven and nature sing and heaven and nature sing
And heaven and heaven and nature sing
Joy to the earth the Savior reigns let men their songs employ
While fields and floods rocks hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy repeat the sounding joy
Repeat repeat the sounding joy
Joy to the world...
He rules the world with truth and grace and makes the nation prove
The glories of his righteousness
And wonders of his love and wonders of his love
And wonders wonders of his love
Joy to the world..."
674,Just As Good As Gone,Dolly Parton,"Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as goneI stand here in the doorway of the room where you lie sleeping
In hopes that I don't wake you up with the sounds of my weeping
It breaks my heart to see you laying there
Alone in the bed we used to share
'Cause you no longer want me and I wonder what went wrong
Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as gone
There's so much more between us than just these lonely walls
The echoes of our dying love lingers in the halls
Living separately together in a house that's not a home
Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as gone
Through the eyes of a broken heart, I watch my whole world fall apart
I'm trying to revive a love that's died
Hopelessly I'm holding on to a love I know is gone
Gone, but not because I haven't tried
Disappearing from your door way now the hurt is twice as strong
Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as gone
Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as gone"
675,Just Because Im A Woman,Dolly Parton,"I can see you're disappointed
By the way you look at me
And I'm sorry that I'm not the woman
You thought I'd be
Yes I've made my mistakes
But listen and understand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman
So when you look at me
Don't feel sorry for yourself
Just think of all the shame
You might have brought somebody else
Just let me tell you this
Then we'll both know where we stand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman
Now a man will take a good girl
And he'll ruin her reputation
But when he wants to marry
Well that's a different situation
He'll just walk off and leave her
To do the best she can
While he looks for an angel
To wear his wedding band
Now I know that I'm no angel
If that's what you thought you'd found
I was just the victim of a man that let me down
Yes, I've made my mistakes
But listen and understand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman
No my mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman"
676,Just Someone I Used To Know,Dolly Parton,"There's a picture that I carry
One we made sometime ago
When they ask who's in the picture with me
I say, ""Just someone I used to know""
Just someone I used to spend some time with
Just a flame that's lost its glow
I don't tell them, how many nights I cry without you
I say, ""Just someone I used to know""
Just someone I used to run around with
Just a friend from long ago
But, I don't tell them, how lost I am without you
I say, ""Just someone I used to know""
I say, ""Just someone I used to know"""
677,Just The Two Of Us,Dolly Parton,"No we can't control the evil that surround us
But as long as we're together that's enough
If there were just the two of us how different things would be
No one could come between us from now on
The wagging tongues would speak no more the sounds of gossip gone
Without a prying ear to fall upon
No we can't control the evil that surround us
But as long as we're together that's enough
Though we have no power over those around us
We can act as if there's just the two of us

Though clouds of doubt may drift about upon a stormy sea
I'll only draw you nearer onto me
As long as we're together we'll never walk alone
We'll build a world of sunshine of our own
No we can't control the evil that surround us..."
678,Just The Way I Am,Dolly Parton,"If you hear me crying in the night
Pretend that you don't hear me it's alright
Don't ask me why I'm crying, please don't make a sound
I don't know why, it's just the way I am
And if you think I act a little strange
And you don't understand when I do things
Like running through the fields while the rain is pouring down
I don't know why, it's just the way I am
And even though you may not understand me
I hope that you'll accept me like I am
For there are many sides of me, my mind and spirit must be free
And I might smile when other folks would frown
I don't know why, it's just the way I am
I might go out chasing butterflies
And if I fail to catch one I might cry
And if you want me you might find me in the meadow walking 'round
I don't know why, it's just the way I am
I might be home and busy cleaning house
And in the middle of my work I might go out
And go play games with children at the playground
It makes me happy, and that's just the way I am
And even though you may not understand me
I hope that you'll accept me like I am
For there are childish sides of me
My mind and spirit must be free
I might smile when you think I should frown
I don't know why, it's just the way I am"
679,Just When I Need You Most,Dolly Parton,"You packed in the morning
I stared out the window
And I struggled for something to say
You left in the rain without closing the door
I didn't stand in your way
Now I miss you more
Than I missed you before
And now where I'll find comfort, God knows
'Cause you left me
Just when I needed you most
Yes, you left me
Just when I needed you most
Now most every morning
I stare out the window

681,Kentucky Gambler,Dolly Parton,"He wanted more from like
Than four kids and a wife
And a job in the dark Kentucky mines
A twenty-acre farm
With a shacky house and barn
That's all he had
And all he left behind
At gambling he was lucky
So he left Kentucky
Left behind his woman and his kids
Into the gay casino
In Nevada's town of Reno
Kentucky gambler planned to get rich quick
Kentucky gambler, who's gonna love your woman in Kentucky
Who's gonna be the one to give her what she needs
Kentucky gambler, who's gonna raise your children in Kentucky
Who's gonna keep them fed and keep shoes on their feet
At the gamblers' paradise
Lady luck was on his side
Kentucky gambler played his cards just right
He won at everything he played
Kentucky gambler had it made
And he should have quit and gone on home that night
But when you love the greenback dollar
Sorrow's always bound to follow
Reno dreams fade into neon amber
And lady luck, she'll leave you on
She'll saty awhile, and then she's gone
You'd better go on home Kentucky gambler
But a gambler never seems to stop
Til he loses all he's got
And so, Kentucky gambler, he played on
He played til he lost all he won
He was right back where he started from
Then he started wanting to go home
Kentucky gambler, there ain't nobody waiting in Kentucky
When you walked out, somebody else walked in
Kentucky gambler, looks like you ain't really very lucky
Seems to me a gambler looses much more than he wins
So you think about it
Kentucky gambler"
682,Kiss It And Make It All Better,Dolly Parton,"When I was a child
Whenever I'd fall
Skinning my elbows and knees
Mommy or daddy would kiss away tears
Kiss all the places I need
Scraped, scratched to broken
A kiss was a token
That mended and cured every part
Then I grew up and fell in love
Fell so hard that it broke my heart
And now, there you are
To kiss it and make it all better
Kiss me and heal all this hurt
Kiss me all over, and over all over
Cause that's where it hurts the worst
Damsel in distress in a red satin dress
A knight with his armor askew
Two broken hearts and all other parts
Left in lost love's residue
Came in for a drink, so I wouldn't think
To erase every thought from my head
But on second thought, I thought we ought
To see each other safely abed
Kiss it and make it all better
Kiss me and heal all this hurt
Kiss me all over, and over all over
Cause that's where it hurts the worst
I need a shoulder to cry on, to lean on
Two loving arms to hold me
Tender words said to make me forget
And two lips to kiss me to sleep
So kiss it and make it all better
Kiss me and heal all this hurt
Kiss me all over, and over all over
Cause that's where it hurts the worst
Kiss me tonight and make it all right
Just kiss it and make it all better
Kiss it and make it all better
Kiss me and heal all this hurt
Kiss me all over, and over all over
Cause that's where it hurts the worst
Cause that's where it hurts the worst
Kiss it, make it better
Kiss it, make it better"

684,Laugh The Years Away,Dolly Parton,"A corporation owns the factory I work in
Someone else owns the house we call our home
The bank owns the car we drive around
And we've got something we can call our own
We've got love happiness surrounds us
And we thank the Lord for every single day
And with love we'll always have each other
And together we can laugh the years away

We're so thankful for our lovely children
And I work hard to keep new shoes upon their feet
But sometimes they've not too much on our table
But we've got something that's mighty hard to feed
We've got love happiness surrounds us...
We've got love happiness surrounds us..."

And You're able
To feel my empty cup at the
Master's table
Cause I'm thirsty,
I'm hungry, my eyes aching
You say your love is mine
For the taking
Lord, what I am is
Exactly what you see
And I'm asking you to rescue me
Forgive of my sins and set me free
Lord, if you want me then
Lay Your hands on me
()
I'm a sinner, I'm a looser, I'm a seeker
I need to learn to live, Lord, you're the teacher
Show me how to get my feet up off the ground
Teach me how to fly and never come back down
Everything you are is all I need
And your satisfaction is guaranteed
You sacrificed it all to set me free
So, if you want me

686,Let Her Fly,Dolly Parton,"There's a wreath on the door
She don't live here no more
As of today, she flew home
And we all gathered here
In sorrow and tears
It won't be the same with her gone
There's a place on the hill
That's peaceful and still
Where she'll sleep beside daddy again
The ole' family tree is shedding it's leaves
But we'll all met in heaven again
Chorus:
Oh, she's an angel
Let her fly, let her fly
She's gone home to glory
To her home in the sky
When God sees her comin'
Heaven's choir will smile
And sing, ""oh she's an angel, let her fly, let her fly
Ooh, she's an angel, let her fly""
She used to rock me when I was a child
Sing ""rock of ages"" and ""in the sweet bye and bye""
Her life wasn't easy, oh but how hard she tried
You know she's an angel, lord, so let her fly
Repeat chorus
Tag:
Let her fly
Ooh she's an angel, let her fly"
687,Let Love Grow,Dolly Parton,"Love can grow in the strangest places,
Might find love in strangers faces.
Waiting just around the corner for all you know.
Love can grow where you least expect it,
Take and chance and don't reject it.
Love will grow if one just lets it,
Let love grow.
I know you, have feelings for me too
But you're afraid to try to love again.
I know your heart is true
But this is all so new.
I wonder what I'll do,
If I would let you in.
It's a chance that's worth the taking.
Love is always out there for the making.
Find it in the eyes of someone that you know.
In any color, shape or fashion
There is no denying passion.
Love is always everlasting,
Let love grow.
Yeah
Love can fill the empty spaces,
Dry our tears and all their traces,
Mend our broken hearts and heal our souls.
Hindsights always out to blind you.
Look ahead
And not behind you.
Look for love and let it find you,
Let love grow..
Love will grow if one just lets it,
Let love grow.
Let love grow.."
688,Letter,Dolly Parton,"This is the first letter that I wrote back home to mom and daddy
A few days after I'd moved to Nashville
June 2nd 1964 Nashville Tennesee
Dear mom and daddy I hope this letter finds everybody well and happy
As for me I'm fine I guess I'm just a little lonesome and a whole lot homesick
I got to Nashville OK and I thought I'd better write and let you know
Cause I knew you'd be worried about me
And I don't let you know to worried about me Cause I'm gonna be alright
Once I get settled and used to bein' away from home
I didn't realize how much I loved you and all them noisy kids until I left
And I didn't reaize how hard it was to eave home eiter
Till I started to leave and everybody started cryin' includin' me
I cried almost all the way to Nashville
And I wanted to turn around a few times and come back
But you know how bad I've always wanted to go to Nashville
And be a singer and songwriter
And I believe that if I try long enough and hard enough that someday I'll make it
Don't worry about tryin' to send me any money or anything
Cause I've got a job singin' on the early morning television show
Here called the Eddie Hill Show
And a couple of folks already told me that they might record a couple of my songs
So I'll be makin' enough money to get by
And I don't want you to worryin' about me bein' hungry or anything
And Nashville's not exactly what I thought it was gonna be
But I believe I'm gonna like it here once I get used to it
And I don't want you to worryin' about me gettin' in trouble either
Cause I'll be good just like I promised you I would when I left
Well can't think of anything else to say
I guess I'd better close for now and you write me real soon
And tell everybody I said hello and I'm gonna be real anxious to hear from you
Cause I sure miss you and I love you an awful lot
With love as always Dolly"
689,Letter To Heaven,Dolly Parton,"An old man was sitting at his table one day
Writing a letter to pass time away
His little granddaughter climbed up on his knee
Saying won't you please write a letter for me
Oh what must I say in this letter I pray
Tell mommy I miss her since she went away
I coming to see her real soon I hope
He choked back a big lump that rose in his throat
He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope
To God up in heaven you'll get it I hope
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail
Her big eyes were shining her little face pale
She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way
And when she stepped out never looked either way
A big auto hit her and sped away fast
The little girls prayers had been answered at last
The postman was passing and picked up the note
Addressed to the Master and these words he spoke
Straight up into heaven this letter did go
She's happy up there with her mommy I know"
690,Life Rides The Train,Dolly Parton,"LIFE RIDES THE TRAIN
WRITER PORTER WAGONER
Time waits for no one time never will
But moments of happiness can make time seem still
But time moves on swiftly passes life by while life rides the train time always flies
Life rides the train for some it moves slow
Some never find where their train of life will go
If it's bound to hell or to heaven on high
And while life rides the train time always flies
As life rides the train some get off the track
For one careless moment but never get back
Until it's much too late time has passed them by
So while life rides the train time always flies
Life rides the train..."

Is the best time to determine if it抯 real
Baby, finding you gave my whole world reason to rhyme
Cause life抯 like poetry and in my poem bay
Until now there抯 always been a missing line
Life抯 too short to think about right or wrong
And the only thing I wonder 慴out
Is where you been so long
Cause baby finding you gave my whole world reason and rhyme
And life抯 like poetry and in my poem bay
Until now there抯 always been a missing line
Until now, there's always been a missing line"

And I've been a waitin' for the morning
It's been a long hard fight
But I see a brand new day a dawning
I've been looking for the sunshine

And everything's gonna work out just fine
And everything's gonna be all right
That's been all wrong

I can see the light of a brand new day
I can see the light of a clear blue morning
And everything's gonna be all right

Those clinging vines
That had me bound, well I don't need 'em
I've been like a captured eagle,
You know, an eagle's born to fly
Now that I, I've won my freedom
Like an eagle, I am eager for the sky

693,Little Bird,Dolly Parton,"Beauty is a rare perfume
Precious, yet doesn't last long
Youth is but a playful breeze
That blows our way once then moves on
Love is a hidden treasure
Some never find where it lies
And memory is a little bird
Flies through life, live or dies
Chorus:
Little bird
Take me aboard your beautiful wings and let me fly
Fly me away back to yesterday
And drop me off there awhile
Let me smell the rare perfume of the sweet flower of beauty again
Let me run in the playful breeze of youth long gone with the wind
Let me sit for awhile by the place where I found the treasure of love
Then sing me a song as you fly me along on our long last journey above"

695,Little Bitty Pissant Country Place,Dolly Parton,"It's just a little bitty pissant country place
Ain't nothin' much to see
No drinking allowed, we get a nice quiet crowd, plain as it can be

Ain't nothing to hide at all
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
But there's nothing dirty going on
Nothing dirty going on
We get simple farmers, local business men
Congress folks from Austin, young boys looking for sin
Now we used to get a lot of rough necks, when the oil boom was high
But pay day would get a little rowdy, thank God the field ran dry
Chorus:
It's just a little bitty pissant country place, nothing much to see
No drinking allowed, we get a nice quiet crowd, plain as it can be
It's just a piddly squatin no time country place, nothing to hide at all
Just lots of good will, and maybe one small thrill, but there's nothing dirty going on
I don't hire no married girl, they're not on the ball
They got homes and husbands, they're not stable at all
You know they don't understand a thing about a proper business day
Now what's the point in opening up the store if you give the goods away
Repeat Chorus
Keep your language clean girls, keep your bedrooms neat
And don't hang around the town cafe and say hi on the street
Mind you P's and Q's and manners, and you don't need no other tools
Cause every girl that lives here knows my special no-no rules
Yea every girl that lives here knows Miss Mona's no-no rules
Ruby, Ray start em!
Beds are not to be wallowed in
That's the kind of thing that big fat lazy hogs do
And it don't make money!
Betrix!
I won't tolerate no tying my telephone with other peoples business
Eloise honey!
And please don't show us no tattoos
No hearts and flowers on your thigh
It's downright tacky
Brands for the cattle and that ain't what we're selling at Miss Mona's
Do you catch my drift?
I pay the food and the rent and the utilities
You keep your mind on your work responsibilities
Don't let your mouth overload your capabilities
And we can get along
Dawn!
Any bad habits you come in with, get rid off right now
Tatty Joe!
I can't stand no chewing gum it looks just like a cow
Lindy Lue!
Any one taking sick leave for to make real sure their sick
And every time you hear that bell...
You better get here double quick
And as for pimps
Pimps are something you don't need
To get your daily business done
Are you listening good?
Keep them leaches and blood suckers of the bathrobes
And I know how to use a gun
And nobody messes with my girls
And any questions you might have about the way I run this place
Don't grip and whine behind my back
Just tell me face to face, I'm open-minded, say it all
Then go upstairs and pack, the door's that way
She pays the food and the rent and the utilities
We keep our mind on our work responsibilities
Don't let your mouth overload your capabilities
And we can get along
Repeat Chorus
It's just a little bitty pissant country place, nothing much to see
No drinking allowed, we get a nice quiet crowd, plain as it can be
It's just a piddly squatin no time country place, nothing to hide at all
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
But there's nothing dirty going on
Nothing dirty going on"
696,Little Blossom,Dolly Parton,"Oh dear I'm so tired and so lonesome
I wonder why mommy don't come
She told me to shut up my blue eyes
And before I woke up she'd be home
She said she was going to see Grandma
Who lives by the river so wide
And I guess my mommy fell in there
And perhaps she won't be home tonight
So I guess I'll go down and meet daddy
Perhaps he has stopped at the store
It's a great big store full of bottles
And I wish he wouldn't go there anymore
So out in the night with the baby
Her little heart beating with pride
'Til her tired feet entered the gin palace
With music all radiant with light
Oh daddy she cried as she reached him
I think that the music's so sweet
But it's almost suppertime daddy
Little blossom wants something to eat
A moment his blurred eyes gazed wildly
Down into her face sweet and fair
And as the demon possessed him
He grasped at the back of a chair
A moment a second was over
He lifted her fair golden head
A moment the baby's life trembled
Then poor little blossom was dead"
697,Little Drummer Boy,Dolly Parton,"Come they told me our pa ra pa pum pum
A newborn King to see pa ra pa pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring pa ra pa pum pum
To lay before the King pa ra pa pum pum
Ra pa pum pum ra pa pum pum ra pa pum pum
So to honor him pa ra pa pum pum when we come
Little baby pa ra pa pum pum
I am a poor boy too pa ra pa pum pum
I have no gift to bring pa ra pa pum pum
That's fit to give a King pa ra pa pum pum
Ra pa pum pum ra pa pam pam ra pa pum pum
Oh shall I play for you pa ra pa pum pum on my drum
(Mary nodded yes pa ra pa pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time pa ra pa pum pum
I played my drum for him pa ra pa pum pum
I played my best for him pa ra pa pum pum
Ra pa pum pum ra pa pum pum ra pa pum pum)
Then he smiled at me pa ra pa pum pum me and my drum
Me and my drum me and my drum
I played for him on my drum on my drum"

699,Little Sparrow,Dolly Parton,"
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain

All you maidens heed my warning
Never trust the hearts of men
They will crush you like a sparrow
Leaving you to never mend
They will vow to always love you
Swear no love but yours will do
Then they'll leave you for another
Break your little heart in two

Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain

If I were a little sparrow
Over these mountains I would fly
I would find him, I would find him
Look into his lying eyes
I would flutter all around him
On my little sparrow wings
I would ask him, I would ask him
Why he let me love in vain
I am not a little sparrow
I am just the broken dream
Of a cold false-hearted lover
And his evil cunning scheme

Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain
All you maidens fair and tender
Never trust the hearts of men
They will crush you like a sparrow
Leaving you to never mend

Little sparrow, little sparrow
Oh the sorrow never ends"
700,Livin A Lie,Dolly Parton,"Spotlight's on, it's shining bright
And I like standin' in it
It's only superficial light
But I don't want to end it
It's warmth and glow has taken hold
And I'm caught up in it's shine
A Cinderella fairy tale
I want to claim as mine
Fancy clothes, a magic coach
And happy ever after
Like something from a story book
The Cinderella chapter
But when the clock strikes midnight
And I lie awake in bed
Things my Daddy told me
Keep running through my head
You gotta walk the straight and narrow
And to thine own self be true
Gotta aim straight as an arrow
All eyes are up on you
But sometimes it feels so good
That I can almost justify
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie
Is it wrong for me to want
The sweeter grass that's greener?
To chase the all-American dream
I've always been a dreamer
At the top and still I've got
A heavy heart inside
I keep remembering
Things my Daddy told me as a child
You gotta walk the striaght and narrow
Gotta hold fast to the right
Gotta aim straight as an arrow
Walk onward toward the light
Oh, but when I'm out there in it
I think I might get by
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie
But I don't feel right livin' a lie
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie
All the fame and fortune
Glory and prestige
Can't make me happy if it goes
Against what I believe
And I've sacrificed my honor
My values and my pride
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie
Livin' a lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, I don't feel right"
701,Livin With A Dead Man,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
And Oprah was talkin' on TV this mornin'
She said when love dies, there's no need to keep mourning
The honeymoon's over, there's no vital signs
Though he's the same age I am, he's grown old before my time
And I'm tired of livin' with a dead man
I don't believe that I can
Continue in the manner I've been going
I try to dress up sexy for him
My sexy clothes just bore him
He says he's got a headache
Now my disappointment's showing, ooo-ooo"
702,Living On Memories Of You,Dolly Parton,"My days are as dark as my nights
And I see no sunshine in sight
Your memory keeps blocking my view
And I'm living on memories of you
Can't eat when I'm hungry
Can't sleep when I'm tired
And all of these tears
Can't put out this fire
Your memory just won't turn me loose
And I'm living on memories of you
There's just no forgetting about you
How long can I survive without you
I just can't believe that we're through
And I'm living on memories of you
Can't eat when I'm hungry
I can't sleep when I'm tired
And all of my tears
Can't drown out this fire
Oh, your memory just won't turn me loose
And I'm living on memories of you
Yes, I'm living on memories of you"
703,Loneliness Found Me,Dolly Parton,"Loneliness found me one time too many and I cheated I cheated on you
But I'd give my soul now if only I hadn't but you see what loneliness can do
It seems that you're gone so much from me
And I try to find things to do while you're gone
But I get so lonesome from stayin' at home and it's hard to enjoy things alone
Loneliness found me just one time too many and I cheated yes I cheated on you
But I'd give my life now if only I hadn't but you see what loneliness can do
Loneliness found me"
704,Lonely Comin Down,Dolly Parton,"I woke up this morning in a strange place
I looked into the mirror at a strange face
Then I looked for you but you could not be found
And then I felt the lonely comin' down
I walked across the room to the empty bed
Saw the imprint on the pillow where you laid your head
The presence of you still lingered all around
And once again I felt the lonely comin' down
Then I felt the lonely dripping down my face
As I realized no one could take your place
I wondered where the love had gone that we had found
And then again I felt the lonely comin' down
I wondered where the love had gone that we had found
And again I felt the lonely comin' down
Mmm..."
705,Longer Than Always,Dolly Parton,"Your trembling hands held me near
Your soft warm lips whispered in my ear
You said you'd always love me
And we'd always be together
And you promised me your love would last forever.
Is forever longer than always?
You're gone from me now and you have been for days
And in my mind I can't find the reason why you didn't stay
Unless forever is longer than always.
Is forever longer than always
You're gone from me now and you have been for days
And in my mind I can't find the reason why you didn't stay
Unless forever is longer than always.
Is forever longer than always?..."
706,Looking Down,Dolly Parton,"Duet by Dolly Parton and Porter Wagoner
Writer Porter Wagoner
Copyright 1972

They say the love we steal is a disgrace
That we should be ashamed to look the world in the face
But they don't know how much love we must hide
While the world looks down upon our pride
Seems there's always someone looking down down down
Not knowing inner feelings of the ones they're puttin' down
(The love we feel's as true as a baby's crying sound)
Still there's always someone looking down
We still honor the vows we made long ago
But when there's no love at home it hurts us so
And then your heart begins to look around
Love found us now the world's a looking down
Seems there's always someone...
The love we must keep silent hurts us now but love will always find a way
somehow
Till then the world will look at us and frown
But we'll love each other while they're looking down
Seems there's always someone...
Seems there's always someone looking down"
707,Lord Hold My Hand,Dolly Parton,"Precious Lord, take my hand,
Lead me on, let me stand,
I am tired, I am weak, I am worn;
Through the storm, through the night,
Lead me on to the light:
Refrain
Take my hand, precious Lord,
Lead me home.
When my way grows drear,
Precious Lord, linger near,
When my life is almost gone,
Hear my cry, hear my call,
Hold my hand lest I fall:
Refrain
When the darkness appears
And the night draws near,
And the day is past and gone,
At the river I stand,
Guide my feet, hold my hand:
Refrain"
708,Lost Forever In Your Kiss,Dolly Parton,"This is not at all like me I never thought that I could be
So overcome by anyone like this
But you caught me by surprise caught me before I realized
Now I am lost forever in your kiss
So take me if you want me love me if you will
For you have all control of me and I am yours until
Till you say that you don't want me oh I hope that never will be
For I'm lost forever in your kiss
You're on my mind constantly oh and this is all so new to me
And when you reach for me I can't resist
For I've become a part of you and I'll do anything you want me to
For I am lost forever in your kiss
So take me if you want me..."
709,Lot Of You Left In Me,Dolly Parton,"Oh you took your sweet love from me oh you left me sweet sweet memories
And I cry I cry like a little baby cause there's still a lot of you left in me
Oh there's still a lot of you left in me and I cry cause your love'll set me free
Your love'll set me free
I'll keep holding on to love that used to be cause there's still a lot of you left in me
Oh I still go on to all our favorite places and I still see all our friends we used to see
Oh but I'm thinkin' now I'm just not the same without you
And that there's still a lot of you left in me
Oh there's still a lot of you...
Cause there's still a lot of you left in me"
710,Love City,Dolly Parton,"Welcome to Love City population two
It isn't a big place our little town
But it's filled with lovely sights all around
A park filled with flowers a beautiful lawn
The streets of the driveway that leads to our home
Just a small house on an acre of ground
We call it Love City our little town
Welcome to Love City polulation two
Founded on a little love that just grew and grew
Between me and you
We built our home on Love's Avenue
The taxes are low and it has a nice view
We've got home cooked meals that are fit for a king
And all kinds of love to fill every dream
A room just for friends if they happen to
Visit our Love City population two
Welcome to Love City population two
Founded on a little love that just grew and grew
Welcome to Love City population two"
711,Love Have Mercy On Us,Dolly Parton,"Duet by Dolly Parton and Porter Wagoner
Writer Dolly Parton
Copyright 1973
I wasn't looking for you when I found you I just turned and I saw you there
And I was so lonely and lost when I found you and I needed somebody to care
And it had been so long since I'd been happy or needed or wanted or loved
And now that I've found you let my arms around you oh love have mercy on us
Have mercy on us don't let it be wrong for there is nothing to live all alone
And now that you're mine may love treat us kind oh love have mercy on us
Oh what must we do with this love for each other is it wrong to love one so much
I want to be with you and oh how I miss you oh love have mercy on us
Have mercy on us..."
712,Love I Used To Call Mine,Dolly Parton,"As gentle as soft breezes blowing
As warm as the summer sunshine
As sweet as the dew on the roses
Was the love I used to call mine
Sweet memories keep unfolding
Revealing the past in my mind
But my arms are no longer holding
The love I used to call mine
Gone are the soft gentle breezes
And gone is the warm summer sunshine
And gone like the dew on the roses
Is the love that I used to call mine
Sweet memories keep unfolding
Revealing the past in my mind
Some other arms are now holding
The love I used to call mine
The love that I used to call mine"
713,Love Is Like A Butterfly,Dolly Parton,"Love is like a butterfly
As soft and gentle as a sigh
The multicolored moods of love are like its satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside
It flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing
I feel it when you're with me
It happens when you kiss me
That rare and gentle feeling that I feel inside
Your touch is soft and gentle
Your kiss is warm and tender
Whenever I am with you I think of butterflies
Love is like a butterfly
The multicolored moods of love are like its satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside
It flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing
Your laughter brings me sunshine
Everyday is spring time
And I am only happy when you are by my side
How precious is this love we share
How very precious, sweet and rare
Together we belong like daffodils and butterflies
Love is like a butterfly
As soft and gentle as a sigh
The multicolored moods of love are like its satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside
It flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing"
714,Love Is Only As Strong As Your Weakest Moment,Dolly Parton,"(Bill Owens)
Love is only as strong as your weakest moment
And in that moment of weakness anyone can do wrong
Oh, weak woman, like a crooked river
Follows a path of least resistance
I went in the wrong place at the right time
Where I didn't have any business
Temptation overcame me and now I
I'm ashamed of me
But how can I ask the one I love
For his forgiveness
Love is only as strong as your weakest moment
And in that moment of weakness
Anyone can go wrong"
715,Love Is Out Tonight,Dolly Parton,"As blue skies and daylight darken into night
Surrounding us with beauty as the stars make their light
They spell out our names all the stars up above
As they flicker and shine like letters of love
Then a warm breath of air whispers through the trees
As the leaves on their branches have blown to the breeze
Ripples of water seemed to echo the sound
Love's out tonight there's love all around
Small drops of dew act as nature's perfume
Placing its fragrance on all that's in blue
While I hold you so close your lips touching mine
With nature all around us watching our love entwine
Love's out tonight see the candles in the sky
God lend us the heavens tonight for you and I
A night full of love for all the world to see
Love's out tonight all around you and me
Love's out tonight"
716,Love Is Strange,Dolly Parton,"Added
by
Rex Johnson
(from Nigeria)
Love is strange
Lots of people
Take it for a game
Once you get it
You never want to quit
After you've had it
Your in an awful fit
Your sweet loving
Is better than a kiss
When you leave me
Sweet kisses I miss
Hey, you sexy thing
How do call your love girl?
I say lover girl
And if she doesn't answer
I say you'd better come here lover girl
And if she still doesn't answer
Well then it's
Baby whoa baby, baby baby baby baby ...
You're the one
Tell me something
How do you call your lover boy?
I say come here lover boy
Oh, but what if he doesn't answer
I say, Ah come here love boy
But what if he still doesn't answer
I simply say, Baby, oh my baby
Don't tease me like
My sweet baby
You're the one
Now who could resist that?
Whoa...
Love is strange
Lots of people
Take it for a game
Baby whao baby
My sweet baby
You're the one
When you call your lover girl
Do you ever do that growl thing?
You mean like Baby my sweey baby
You know that growl thing?
My sweet baby
Well how do you call your lover boy?
Well I just do it all kinds of ways
Do you ever just let it all hang out
Well, uh, yes I do and I say
Oh baby ooh my sweet baby
Oh my baby your the one"
717,Love Is Worth Living,Dolly Parton,"I know what you're thinking when you look at me
The love in your eyes is so easy to see
It's real and it's good what I feel for you
Love is worth living when you love like we do
I understand when you're not feeling well
If there's something on your mind I always can tell
I'm there when you need me and you're there when I need you
Love is worth living when you love like we do
Love is worth living when you love like we do
We found the happiness that very few do
You know that I want you and you know that I want you
Love is worth living when you love like we do

Love is worth living...
Love is worth living when you love like we do"
718,Love Isnt Free,Dolly Parton,"The neon lights of a movie marquee
Says the show today is Love Is Free
And inside a boy and a girl on a date
Their folks are gone away they're gonna stay out late
A little later on in a lover's lane
They park in the dark with their hearts in flames
He says oh baby go along with me
I need you so and love is free
In a simple little room in a Chatanooga home
For girls that need a friend and are all alone
She waits for a letter that never comes
From a boy that won't admit what he's done
She had to leave school cause she couldn't stand the shame
Her daddy said she ruined the family name
Her mama cries herself to sleep at night
That's no way to start a young girl's life
Love isn't free no it ain't free
No matter what they say somebody has to pay for love
In an orphanage home a sad little girl
Six years old and all alone in the world
She knows by now what they never say
That she once had a mom but she gave her away
People come to visit but don't choose Marie
She cries at the door nobody loves me
And somewhere a boy doesn't care at all
That her tear at night stains her little rag doll
Love isn't free no it ain't free
No matter what they say somebody has to pay for love
No matter what they say look who's paying for love"
719,Love To Remember,Dolly Parton,"Your love's as fresh in my memory as this morning's sunrise
And still just as beautiful to me
I can still feel the soft touch of love sweet and tender
You give me love to remember
Nights with no ending, filled with love I'm remembering
Each night that I spend with you
I can still feel your soft touch, I can still feel your warm love
You give me love to remember
And each morning when I wake up
Before I leave my pillow. I search through my dreams carefully
Just to make sure that I don't leave one tiny memory
'Cause I dream of the love I remember
Nights with no ending, filled with love I'm remembering
Each night that I spend with you
I can still feel your warm love, I can still feel your soft touch
You give me love to remember
Love to remember"
720,Love With Feeling,Dolly Parton,"(Porter Wagoner)
When your heart feels like a feather in a whirlwind
And you see stars in the middle of the day
And you feel so light you could fly
And you think that any moment the slightest breeze might blow you away
That's love you're feeling
That's love with feeling
Touching, tender love inside your soul
That's love you're feeling
This love with feeling
That takes you away on love wings of solid gold
When you're all alone
And each minute seems like eternity
As thoughts of love come rushing through your mind
In the middle of the night
You feel it kiss you while your alone
Don't be alarmed its only this love of mine
That's love you're feeling
That's love with feeling
Touching, tender love inside your soul
That's love you're feeling
Oh, that's love with feeling
That takes you away on love wings of solid gold
That's love with feeling
Love with feeling"
721,Love With Me,Dolly Parton,"I look at you and I see something special
I feel something special, something that's rare
If you feel the same way when you're lookin' at me
I know there could be a love we could share
Won't you come and love with me
Shelter your love in my castle of dreams
We'll find in each other the things that we need
Won't you come and love with me
We'll sing us a love song the songbirds would envy
A song that the angels would be proud to sing
We'll say with our hearts what no poet could capture
Say with our eyes what no artist could paint
Won't you come and love with me
Shelter your love in my castle of dreams
We'll find in each other the love that we need
Won't you come and love with me
Won't you come and love with me
Shelter your love in my castle of dreams
We'll find in each other the love that we need
Won't you come and love with me
Oh, won't you come and love with me?"
722,Love Youre So Beautiful Tonight,Dolly Parton,"As night falls around us
Love's tender embrace replaces
The sun's golden light
Then love shows us beauty
That only love can describe
Love, you're so beautiful tonight
As you fill our hearts
With tenderness and emotions inside
Lost in each other
With the world closed outside
Oh this must be like heaven
Well, it's heaven to you and I
Love, you're so beautiful tonight
Your nearness in silence
Your rapid heartbeat
Your face touching mine
Then you whisper on my cheek
I'll love you 'til the stars
In the heavens lose their light
Oh love, you're so beautiful tonight
As you fill our hearts
With tenderness and emotions inside
Lost in each other
With the world closed outside
And this must be like heaven
It's heaven to you and I
Love, you're so beautiful tonight
I'll love you 'til the stars
In the heavens lose their light
Love, you're so beautiful tonight"
723,Loves All Over,Dolly Parton,"I can see it on your face
It's over it's all over it's all over me and you
Love came down like the rains from heaven
Love's all over us dripping like the morning dew
We can't hide it anymore you can't hide real love
When it's all over all over me and you
And it's wonderful to know it's all over
Love sweet love it's all over me and you
Once we worried what folks would think if they only knew
Just how much love there was between me and you
Oh but it's no secret anymore it's all out in plain view
And love's all over us love's all over me and you
We can't hide it anymore..."
724,Lover Du Jour,Dolly Parton,"What are you looking at, love boy?
It won't do you any good,
Cause I know your kind!
If you wanna be mine,
We gotta get this understood!
Oh, I'm not gonna be, won't be your love du jour
Your special off the day, no way,
I'll do farewell, bonjour
Pardon my French, but there's no chance in the hell for you, for sure
And if you think that I will be, I'll be your lover du jour
I'm what?
Lover du jour!
Not me!
I am well aware of your good looks and sexy ways
Serving up yourself to girls to satisfy your taste.
The fresh catch of the day, on your Romeo buffet
Served up hot and ready, just having it your way
Well, if I'm on the menu, you'd better get this straight (Lover du jour)
Me and you had better come to terms before you grab your plate.
Don't need once place to order if you believe that I
I'm just some cheesy little dish, just another chickie pie.
No, I won't gonna be, won't be your love du jour
The flavor of the day, no way, I'll do farewell, bonjour
... but there's no chance in the hell that I endure
The fact that I would only be your lover du jour.
Oubliez-moi! Forget me!
Still looking, lover boy?
Have you changed your view?
I told you once, I'll say it again
I'll take no . from you!
That's great!
If you want something appetizing,
Something real and satisfying,
I'll be worth a second look, cause that's the only way!
Cause, I won't gonna be, won't be your love du jour
Your playmate of the day, no way, I'll do farewell, bonjour
Cause I won't be caught up in your charm and your allure
No, I'm not gonna be, won't be your lover du jour!
No, I'm not gonna be, won't be your lover du jour!
No, I won't gonna be, won't be your love du jour
The special off the day, no way, I'll do farewell, bonjour!
Pardon my French, but there's no chance in the hell that I'll endure
The fact that I would only be your lover du jour
No, I'm not gonna be, won't be your lover du jour!
Your lover du jour!
I am not for your amusement
I am not a toy, you are nothing but trouble!
You are a bad boy!
I am a tasty ... around a full course meal
Desert after dinner drink, and you can have no feel..."
725,Lovers Return,Dolly Parton,"And so you have come back to me
And say the old love's growin' yet
You've tried through all these weary years
You've tried to vainly to forget
Oh no, I cannot take your hand
God never gives is back our youth
The lovin' heart you slighted then
Was yours, my friend in perfect truth
Come close and let me see your face
Your raven hair is tinged with snow
Oh, yes, it is the same dear face
I loved so many years ago
Oh no, I cannot take your hand
God never gives is back our youth
The lovin' heart you slighted then
Was yours, my friend in perfect truth
Farewell, I think I love you yet
As friend to friend, God bless you dear
And guide you through these weary years
To where the skies are always clears
Oh no, I cannot take your hand
God never gives is back our youth
The lovin' heart you slighted then
Was yours, my friend in perfect truth
Oh no, I cannot take your hand
God never gives is back our youth
The lovin' heart you slighted then
Was yours, my friend in perfect truth"
726,Lovin You,Dolly Parton,"If you've been wonderin' what I'm gonna do
While you are sleepin', am I sleepin', too
Well I just sittin' here lovin' you
Close my eyes an' lovin' you
I'm just sittin' back, sittin' here lovin' you
An' I have been wonderin' just what I would do
If I weren't sleepin', had I not found you
Well I'd be outside findin' you
I'd be walkin' on the avenue findin' you
Well, I'm just sittin' back, sittin' here lovin' you
Now the reason that you never see me runnin' 'round
Fingers on my forehead couldn't calm me down
An' he can't even get me up and on my feet
When I've got to take care of some business on the street
I have been walkin' all my streets alone
But I won't keep walkin' to keep from goin' home
Couldn't quite barely concieve of you
Aw, an' I'm just sittin' back, sittin' here lovin' you
If you've been wonderin' what I'm gonna do
While you are sleepin', am I sleepin', too
Well I just sittin' here lovin' you
I just close my eyes an' lovin' you
Aw, an' I'm just sittin' back sittin' here lovin' you"
727,Made Of Stone,Dolly Parton,"Another sleepless night alone, crazy from this jealousy. 
I heard you call her on the phone, 
Watched you shave and dress and leave. 
Walk the floor and watch the clock, 
Knowing that you ain't missing me. 
Imagination runnin' hot, and you're right where you wanna be. 
Do you think I'm made of stone? 
Do you think it doesn't hurt when you leave me here alone, 
Leaving me to think the worst? 
And when you're out there in her arms 'til the wee hours of the dawn, 
Do you think it's all a joke? 
Can't you see my heart is broke? 
Do you think I'm made of stone? 
I'm just barely gettin' 'round, 
Don't know how I'm getting by. 
All our friends I meet in town, 
They just can't look me in the eye. 
They all know you're runnin' 'round. 
Like me, they don't know what to do. 
God, I hate their sympathy, 
But I just can't turn loose of you. 
But do you think I'm made of stone? 
Don't you know my pain is real? 
It's the worst I've ever known just stayin' at an even keel. 
Oh, what am I supposed to do while you cheat and carry on? 
I should leave, I know I should; 
I just only wish I could. 
Do you think I'm made of stone? 
Oh, it cuts me like a knife, 
You have stripped me of my pride. 
What am I supposed to do while you cheat and carry on? 
Do you think it's all a joke? 
Can't you see my heart is broke? 
Do you think I'm made of stone? 
Another sleepless night alone, 
I guess you think I'm made of stone."
728,Make Love Work,Dolly Parton,"Of all the roads I've traveled and all the sights I've seen
The most amazing thing is the power of our dreams
And anything is possible for those who can believe
Just get your heart to rearrange its priorities
For us to make love work
We've got to try a little harder
And for love to work we gotta hold on
A human heart is just too precious
To spend it feeling hurt
Let's start to take the chance to make love work
It takes faith in one another to see things eye to eye
And it's hard to trust but you know it's worth the try
There's a candle in my window and whenever you feel blue
You can bet your bottom dollar I'll be there for you
For us to make love work
We've got to try a little bit harder
And for love to work we gotta hold on
A human heart is just too precious
To spend it feeling hurt
Let's start to take the chance to make love work
Oh I do believe in miracles
But I know they don't come easy
So why don't we give destiny
A helping hand
For us to make love work
We've got to try a little bit harder
And for love to work we gotta hold on
A human heart is just too precious
To spend it feeling hurt
Let's start to take the chance to make love work
Life is just too beautiful
To spend it feeling hurt
Let's start to take the chance to make love work"
729,Making Believe,Dolly Parton,"Making believe that you still love me
It's leaving me alone and so blue
I'll always dream, still I'll never own you
Making believe, its all I can do
Can't hold you close when you're not with me
You're somebody's love, you'll never be mine
Making believe that I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you and making believe
Making believe that I never lost you
But my happy hours are fun and so few
My plans for the future will never come true
Making believe what else can I do
Can't hold you close when you're not with me
You're somebody's love, you'll never be mine
Making believe that I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you and making believe"
730,Making Plans,Dolly Parton,"You say tomorrow you're going
It's so hard for me to believe
I'm making plans for the heartaches
'Cause you're making plans to leave
The tears for me will be falling
Like a tree shedding its leaves
I'm making plans for the tear drops
'Cause you're making plans to leave
You're making plans to forget me
I'm making plans to miss you
I'm getting ready ti grieve
I'm making plans to be lonesome
'Cause you're making plans to leave
I'm making plans to be lonesome
'Cause you're making plans to leave"
731,Malena,Dolly Parton,"(A wish that Malena had wings)
Malena for hours would run in the meadow
Well Malena would go to play every day
She chased butterflies and she'd say with the smile
If I had wings I could fly that away
Malena would cry when we try to explain
That little girl's world's supposed to have wings
That only in heaven can little girls fly
We'd see a strange look in Malena's eyes
(A wish that Malena had wings)
We'll always remember Malena's last birthday
Boxes with bright colored ribbon and string
And the wish that she made as she blew out the candles
A wish that Malena had wings
And with all the gifts that we bought for Malena
The wish that she made we could not satisfy
But on the night of her birthday the angels fullfilled it
They gave her wings and now Malena can fly
Malena has wings and Malena can fly
On the wings of an angel in heaven on high
From the time she could talk her wish was the same
A wish that Malena had wings
(A wish that Malena had wings)"
732,Mama Say A Prayer,Dolly Parton,"The bright lights of the city are a pretty site to see.
Perhaps they're extra pretty to a country girl like me.
Temptation waits at every turn and it won't let me be.
So mama, when you pray tonight, say a special prayer for me.
I miss your tender good-night kiss
Of love and understanding.
The good-night kisses I get now,
Are cruel and so demanding.
So mama when you pray tonight,
And while you're on your knees,
Mama say a special prayer for me.
The nights get cold and lonely when you're faraway from home,
And lonely makes it easy for a good girl to go wrong.
Evil eyes search through the night for lonely girls like me,
So mama when you pray tonight, say a special prayer for me.
I miss your tender good-night kiss
Of love and understanding.
The good-night kisses I get now,
Are cruel and so demanding.
So mama when you pray tonight,
And while you're on your knees,
Mama say a special prayer for me."
733,Mammie,Dolly Parton,"Mammie delivered me into this world
Mammie watched my mama die at my birth
And Mammie she loved me she took me to raise
Mammie was all I had on this earth
Let's get in the firewood, I'd hear Mammie say
Let's go to the spring before it gets dark
And you do up the dishes while the water's still hot
And don't throw that dishwater out in the yard
Oh Mammie taught me how to sing a song
She taught me to play her old guitar
And at night before bedtime we'd sing for hours
As the teakettle whistled along on the fire
And at night as I laid alone in my bed
I'd hear Mammie praying and each night she said
Oh dear God help me raise her to know right from wrong
And I pray she'll do right even after I 'm gone.
I'd wait until Mammie had fallen asleep
Then out of my window I'd quietly sneak
And I'd wait by the mill pond according to plans
And there in the darkness I'd meet a man
Oh it's not that I wanted to bring Mammie shame
I just couldn't control wild blood in my veins
They tell me my mama could not name my dad
So I guess it was natural for me to be bad
One night I awoke at the sound of my name
Come quickly, I heard Mammie cry
She said you be good and I told her I would and
That night I watched as my Mammie died
All I have now are the memories of Mammie
And the goodness that loving her brought me
Although she is gone in my heart she lives on
And I know how much good she taught me.
Ah Mammie, I'm being good Mammie ..."
734,Marry Me,Dolly Parton,"Well I met a boy from Grassy Branch
Fine as he can be
I met him at the big barn dance
And he took a shine to me
Sky-blue eyes, a big wide smile
And tall as a sycamore tree
He's real smart with a real big heart
And he's going to marry me
He's going to marry me
And we're going to go to town
We're going to buy some real good car
And we're going to drive around
We'll hold hands and touch and hug
He talks so sweet to me
Because he knows a lot about love and stuff
And he's going to marry me
His momma don't like me one little bit
But you know I don't care
Let her pitch her hissy-fit
Because I am not marrying her
He's always been a momma's boy
It's just plain jealousy
She's as mad as an old red hen
Because he's going to marry me
Oh, and he's going to marry me
And he's going to buy me a ring
We're going to be so free
Cut momma's apron strings
He's going to build me a pretty little house
Have a pretty little made-for-three
Because he's done kiss me on the mouth
And he's going to marry me
Oh, and he's going to marry me
And he's going to buy me a ring
We're going to be so free
Cut momma's apron strings
He's going to build me a pretty little house
Have a pretty little made-for-three
Because he's done kiss me on the mouth
And he's going to marry me
Yeah, he's done kiss me on the mouth
And he's going to marry me
Yodel-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de"
735,Mary Of The Wild Moor,Dolly Parton,"On a cold winty night as the winds blew across the wild moor
Poor Mary came wandering home with her child
Till she came at her own father's door
Papa oh papa she cried come down and open the door
Or the child in my arms will perish and die
From the winds that blow across the wild moor
But the man was deaf to her cry not a sound of her voice did he hear
While the watch dogs did howl and the village bells tolled
The winds blew across the wild moor
Oh how the old man must have felt
When he came to the door the next morn
And found Mary dead but the child yet alive
Clutched close to his dead mother's breast
Now the old man in grief pined away
And the day to it's mother went soon
And no one they say has lived there to this day
And the cottage is left to ruins
Now the villagers point out the place
Where the willows droop over the door
Saying there Mary died once a gay village bride
From the winds that blew across the wild moor
From the winds that blew across the wild moor"
736,Me And Bobby Mcgee,Dolly Parton,"Busted flat in Baton rouge
Headin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
I was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time
And Bobby clappin' hands
We finally sang up every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
And nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
From the coal mines of Kentucky
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me
Through everything I've done
And every night he kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find
And I'll trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
And nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
Enough for me and Bobby McGee
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he finds
Enough for me and my Bobby McGee
Enough for me and my Bobby McGee, yeah"
737,Me And Little Andy,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
Late one cold and stormy night I heard a dog a' barkin' 
Then I thought I heard somebody at my door a' knockin' 
I wondered who could be outdide in such an awful storm 
Then I saw a little girl with a puppy in her arms 
Before I could say a word she said, 'My name is Sandy 
And this here is my puppy dog, it's name is little Andy' 
Standing in the bitter cold in just a ragged dress 
Then I asked her to come in and this is what she said 
Ain't ya got no gingerbread 
Ain't ya got no candy 
Ain't ya got an extra bed for me and little Andy 
Patty cake and bakersman 
My mommy ran away again 
And we was all alone and didn't know what else to do 
I wonder if you'll let us stay with you 
Giddy up trotty horse, going to the mill 
Can we stay all night 
If you don't love us no one will 
I promise we won't cry 
London bridge is fallin' down 
My daddy's drunk again in town 
And we was all alone and didn't what we could do 
I wonder if you'll let us stay with you 
She was just a little girl, not more than six or seven 
But that night as they slept the angels took them both to heaven 
God knew little Andy would be lonesome with her gone 
Now Sandy and her puppy dog won't ever be alone 
Ain't ya got no gingerbread 
Ain't ya got no candy 
Ain't ya got an extra bed for me and little (whispers) Andy"
738,Medley,Dolly Parton,"Sleigh bells ring are you listening in the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight we're happy tonight walking in the winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird here to stay is a newbird
He sings a love song as he goes alone walking in the winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build the snowman and pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married we'll say no man but you can do the job when you're in town
Later on we'll conspire as we dream by the fire
The face unafraid the plans that we made walking in the winter wonderland
Just hear those sleigh bells jingleing ring ting tingleing too
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling you hoo
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
In the meadow we can build the snowman...
The face unafraid the plans that we made walking in the winter wonderland"
739,Mendy Never Sleeps,Dolly Parton,"Mendy is sixteen and uncontrolable Mendy is only a child
Mendy is in with the in-crowd Mendy is ever so wild
Mendy's hair hangs straight and long Mendy feels this is a must
Mini skirts and many friends and many heartaches for us
Mendy finds a plenty to do but Mendy never sleeps
Mendy slips out of the house in the evening when the sun is sinking
Mendy is out with the in-crowd Mendy is smoking and drinking
There's a different shine in Mendy's eyes
And the color is gone from her cheeks
Mendy is a swinger but Mendy never sleeps
Mendy never sleeps and Mendy is growing weak
Mendy lies lifeless and limp in our arms now....
Oh Mendy please don't go to sleep"
740,Milwaukee Here I Come,Dolly Parton,"(Lee Fikes)
I'm gonna get on that old turnpike and I'm gonna ride
I'm gonna leave this town 'til you decide
Which one you want the most, them Opery stars or me
Milwaukee here I come from Nashville, Tennessee
Milwaukee's where we were before we came here
Working in a brewery, making the finest beer
She came to me on a payday night, said
""Let's go to Tennessee,"" so we came down to Nashville to the Grand Ole Opery
We turned on the TV, Porter Wagoner was singing loud
I said that's the man for me, I love him, there's no doubt
I'm leaving now see if I can find out where he's at
And if I can't find him, I'll settle for that bluegrass Lester Flatt
I'm going now and trade my old Ford for an Olds
I might get all drunked up and trade it for a Rolls
But there's one thing I know for sure, I'll always be blue
There ain't no way to get drunk enough to stop loving you"
741,Mine,Dolly Parton,"A little white house with black wooden shadows
A porch with its columns all covered with vine
My broken dream house where he lives with another
But this was supposed to be mine
Two little children that look like their daddy
With the same smile and the same eyes that shine
The only thing wrong I'm not their mommy
But they were supposed to be mine
He's given to her what he promised to me
The plans that we made never can be
For each night he holds and carresses another
And she is supposed to be me
He's given to her what he promised to me
The plans that we made never can be
For each night he holds and carresses another
And she is supposed to be me
And he is supposed to be mine"
742,Miss Youmiss Me,Dolly Parton,"Miss me,
Don't you miss someone to hold you, now in the end?
And kiss me
And tell me I'm your lil' girl again
Daddy, when you left, did you remove yourself
From every sweet remembrance of me?
I'm always missing you, I hope you miss me too
And everything we were and still could be
Miss little things like walking in the park
Miss summer nights with fireflies in the jar
Big memories of you playing your guitar
Miss all of this, it's true, but mostly I miss you
'Cause no one else could ever take your place
And momma, don't you miss that home is all about
And all the drama caused by the anger you keep acting out?
Why can't you both just see, you didn't divorce me?
Forgive, forget and try to get along
I miss us being close, I love and miss you both
Don't miss the plea I've written in my song
Your little miss is missing out on you
And you're both missing out on so much too
Put pride aside and do what you should do
Don't make me have to choose,
'Cause I love the both of you
Just let resentment go, and think of me
You've torn my world apart, and it breaks my little heart
Can't you see me? And see me missing you?
Oooh, I miss you, I miss you, miss me!
Miss me! I miss you. Miss me!"
743,Missing You,Dolly Parton,"Somebody's missing you
Longs to be kissing you
You'd better listen
You mean all the world to me
You're on somebody's mind
Just almost all the time
Bet you already knew
Somebody's missing you
The days go slowly by
When I'm away from you
I long to see your smile
And feel the warmth of you
I've loved you for so long
But still we feel brand new
At home, inside your arms
Somebody's missing you
Somebody's missing you
Longs to be kissing you
You'd better listen
You mean all the world to me
You're on somebody's mind
I hope you miss me too
Somebody's missing you
Last thought before I sleep
First thought when I awake
You're even in my dreams
And I can hardly wait
To hear your voice again
Saying all the things you do
In case you're wondering
Somebody's missing you
Somebody's missing you
Longs to be kissing you
You'd better listen
You mean all the world to me
You're on somebody's mind
Just almost all the time
I know you know I do
Somebody's missing you
In case you're wondering
Somebody's missing you
Really, really, really, really missing you"
744,Mission Chapel Memories,Dolly Parton,"(Porter Wagoner & Dolly Parton) 
Tonight all is quiet in Mission Chapel 
And the music, like his love, has died away 
And I'm standing in the middle of these memories 
Mission Chapel memories of our wedding day 
I see the rice still scattered all around 
That veil upon my satin wedding gown 
And the wedding bells that rang are silent now 
Only Mission Chapel memories all around 
Tonight I'm all alone at Mission Chapel 
And I'm thinking of my love so far away 
While I'm standing in the middle of all these memories 
Mission Chapel memories of our wedding day 
I see the rice still scattered all around 
That veil upon my satin wedding gown 
The gown I wore when I became his bride 
And now these Mission Chapel memories fill my eyes 
As these Mission Chapel memories fill my eyes"
745,Mommie Aint That Daddy,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
The snow was fallin' swiftly and it mounted on the street
Little footprints in the snow made by our children's feet
As I walked them to the good will store to get some clothes to wear
As we turned around the corner I saw you standing there
I tried to turn the children and walk the other way
I prayed they hadn't seen you then I heard the baby say
""Mommie, ain't that Daddy holding out his hand
Begging for money from that other man?""
They asked me ""Ain't that Daddy?""
And ""Yes"" I had to say
And I wondered if I'd failed you
And made you turn this way
No, you didn't fail me, my weakness was just too strong
Because you see, I thought more of the bottle than our family and our home
No, you didn't fail me sweetheart, you loved me all you could
You had my babies and you loved me like no other woman ever would
You know I guess I'd be better off dead
Than in the awful shape I'm in
But death just don't seem to have a place for those that stay drunk on whiskey, wine and gin
You see I die a constant death over and over every day
If I could change, you know I'd do it for you, the babies and our home
But you might as well forget me for I'm just too forward gone
But I wish you would do me one last favor and do it just for me
When they ask you, ""Momma ain't that Daddy?""
Just say ""It used to be"""
746,Monkeys Tale,Dolly Parton,"(Leona Reese)
Oh, the monkey's had a better tale than you
Compare to yours all their tales sound so true
The way you're actin' seems to me at all the monkey should go free
You're the one that should be locked up in the Zoo.
When I married you I thought you were a man
But you're the biggest ape that's living in this land
I'd like to run you up a tree for the way you lie to me
Your swingin' round is gettin' out of hand.
Oh, the monkey's had a better tale than you
Compare to yours all their tales sound so true
The way you're actin' seems to me at all the monkey should go free
You're the one that should be locked up in the Zoo.
Every monkey has its day so go ahead and play
Make your plans and tell your lies and stick to them
But from now on I remind you can wag your tail behind you
Cause you finally got yourself out on a limb.
--- Instrumental ---
Every monkey has its day a better tale than you
Compare to yours all their tales sound so true
The way you're actin' seems to me at all the monkey should go free
You're the one that should be locked up in the Zoo.
Oh, the monkey's had a better tale than you..."
747,More Than I Can Say,Dolly Parton,"Your love is like a gentle breeze
That's always blowin' over me
I know you're all I'll ever need
In each and every way
You're both ends of the rainbow
My colors and my pot of gold
I love you with a love untold
More than I can say
You are the song of every bird
You are the poet's every word
Every artist's picture
Every writer's play
You are the glow in every night
You are the warmth in each sunrise
Makes no difference how I try
It's more than I can say
And when I've needed you
You've always been there for me
Been my friend and stood by me
And held me as you loved the world away
And when I've wanted you
You have satisfied my needs
Fullfilled all my fantasies
I love you more and more each day
More than I can say
Oh and sometimes I watch you gently sleep
Listen as you softly breathe
Touch you skin and kiss you sweet
And love you all the way
I reach for you
You come to me
Love me into ecstacy
I will love you endlessly
More than I can say
And when I've needed you
You've always been there for me
Been my friend and stood by me
And held me as you loved the world away
And when I've wanted you
You have satisfied my needs
Fullfilled all my fantasies
I love you more and more each day
More than I can say
I love you more and more each day
More than I can say
More than I can say
More than I can say
More than I can say"
748,More Than Their Share,Dolly Parton,"I give an inch and you take a mile and you tell me to jump and I just ask how
high
I've been over backwards to show you I care
And someone must always give more than their share
I say I'm sorry when the fault is not mine
And I take the blame for our fights all the time
I love you so much and it doesnt seem fair
That someone must always give more than their share
I know you well enough to know you would never admit you were wrong
And you know me well enough to know I give in cause my love is so strong
If I give an inch and you take a mile if you tell me to jump well I just ask
how high
I've been over backwards to show you I care
Cause someone must always give more than their share
Yes someone must always give more than their share"
749,More Than Words Can Tell,Dolly Parton,"When you're rocking back and forth there by the window
And the sun shines through the silver in your hair
I'll think of all the years we've spent together
And of all the good and bad times we have shared
We've seen happiness that could match heaven's beauty
And each sadness like the flaming pits of hell
But each thing we share just makes our love grow stronger
And I love you more than words could ever tell
When the golden years have slowly come upon us
And our children have all married off and gone
You know sweetheart each day our love grows more exciting
And I love you more as each day passes on
We've seen happiness that could match heaven's beauty
And we love each other more than words can tell
And each day as we grow closer to God's calling
I pray he'll call us at the same time there to dwell
We've seen happiness...
Yes I love you more than words could ever tell"
750,More Where That Came From,Dolly Parton,"I've been through hell and half of Louisiana
Lookin' for a man like you
I know you could have any woman you want
And I know you've had a few
I know I've got some stiff competition
They ain't got nothin' on me
'Cause I've got something that you've been missin'
I practice what I preach
Chorus:
'Cause I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your friend
And I wanna be your full-time woman
Closer than your kin
I wanna be your satisfaction

Well, I have just begun
'Cause there's more where that came from
There's more where that came from
And I want your clothes in my closet
My name on your mail
And I want my love to be your faucet
Drinkin' from an endless well
I want your kids to call me Mama
I want you to call me Hun
I wanna be the one you love and honor
When it's all been said and done

'Cause I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your friend
And I wanna be your full-time woman
Closer than your kin

751,Most Of All Why,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
'75 Velvet Apple Music
We once were so close now the love light that glowed has now gone out of our
lives
And the good life we had for some reason went bad
And the love that once lived here has died
How did we get here where did it start when did we walk out of each other's
heart
Where did we lose it how did love die when where and how but most of all why
Most of all why did we let love die like the withering leaves in the fall
And why did we wait till it was too late to realize how much we'd lost
How did we get here...
When where and how but most of all why"
752,Mountain Angel,Dolly Parton,"Pretty as an angel from the day that she was born
Skin as fair as Lily's hair, as golden as the corn
They knew that she was special from the moment she first cried
She was a mountain angel certified
She was her momma's baby, she was her daddy's pride
Good at home, at church and school, at everything she tried
Everybody's darlin' led a charmed and peaceful life
The perfect mountain angel 'til he arrived
And ohh, she fell so deeply
Ooh, she couldn't stop
She gave herself to him, milled it completely
He lifted her so high he let her drop
She gave up everything for him that mattered in her life
All the others that had loved her and she vowed to be his wife
She dreamed of bearing children in an ivy-covered house
The mountain angel's sunshine turned to clouds
The wicked handsome stranger left the way he came
Broke her heart and broke her mind
She never was the same
They say he was the devil
That had come to steal her soul
She never loved another it was told
They say she had a baby
Some say that it had died
They it's just as well
As it had been the devil's child
They say good conquers evil
But here, evil won the prize
So the mountain angel took to the wild
And ooh, she couldn't take it
Years passed and she had long since lost her mind
She waited for him as her beauty faded
Her parents died from grief before their time
She tried to gather pieces of her life, they wouldn't fit
Beside the tiny grave deep in the woods is where she'd sit
Talking to the child, herself, to him, who knew for sure
Possessed they say by satan's insane lure
High a'top the mountain, for years they say she's seen
Looking down upon the town where she had once been queen
She'd sneak around the playground, watch the little children play
They'd see the crazy lady then run away
They say she roamed these hills for years, wearing not a stitch
The lovely mountain angel now thought to be a witch
She made those wailing mournful sounds
That you could hear for miles
Long after she laid down upon her baby's grave and died
And ooh, her ghost is callin'
She's waiting for the ones that she adored
Through spring and summer, fall when snow is fallin'
Her spirit roams these hills forever more
The mountain angel's voices ever more
Oohh, oooo
Oohh, oooo
Oohh, oooo"
753,Mr Sandman With Emmylou Harris And Linda Ronstadt,Dolly Parton,"Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen
Give him two lips like roses and clover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over
Sandman, I'm so alone
Don't have nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic brean
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen
Give him the word that I'm not a rover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Give him a pair of eyes with a come hither gleam
Give him a lonely heart like Pagliacci
And lots of wavy hair like Liberace
Mister Sandman, someone to hold
Would be so peachy before we're too old
Sp please turn on your magic beam
Mister Sandman, bring us
Please, please, please"

755,My Blue Ridge Mountain Boy,Dolly Parton,"From a shack by a mountain stream
To a room in New Orleans
So far from my Blue Ridge mountain home
The men I meet, ain't warm and friendly
Like the one in old 'virginny
Oh they ain't real, like my Blue Ridge mountain boy
I was just a little past 18
When I came to New Orleans
I'd never been beyond my home state line
There was a boy who loved me dearly
But I broke his heart severely
When I left my Blue Ridge mountain boy
Life was dull in my home town
The lights were out when the sun went down
And I thought the city life was more my style
But nights get lonely waiting home
And its easy to go wrong
The men ain't kind
Like my Blue Ridge mountain boy
New Orleans held things in store
Things I'd never bargained for
And every night a different man knocks on my door
But late at night when all is still
I can hear a whiporwill, as I cry, for my Blue Ridge mountain boy
Oh but I can ever go back home
Since the boy I love is gone
He grew tired of waiting for me to return
They say he married, last October
But I never will get over
Oh, the sweet love of my Blue Ridge mountain boy
Blue Ridge Mountain Boy, mmmmhmmmmmm"
756,My Blue Tears,Dolly Parton,"
Fly away from my window, little bluebird
Fly as far as you can away from here
And let not your song fall upon my ear
Go spread your blue wings and I'll shed my blue tears
For the one that I have loved
He has left me and gone
And I am in no mood for to hear your sad song

Bring not your light into my dark room, yellow sunshine
Waste not your warmth on the cold glisten here
Oh, trouble me not, go ye' elsewhere
Go light your blue sky and I'll shed my blue tears
For the only one that I have ever loved has gone away
And I am in no mood for the sunshine today

Go spread your blue wings
Go light your blue sky
And I'll shed my blue tears"
757,My Country Tis,Dolly Parton,"My country tis of thee
Sweet land of liberty
Of thee I sing
Land where my fathers died
Land of the pilgrim's pride
From every mountain side
Let freedom ring
My native country, thee
Land of the noble free
Thy name I love
I love thy rocks and rills
Thy woods and templed hills
My heart with rapture fills
Like that above
Let music swell the breeze
And ring from all the trees
Sweet freedom's song
Let mortal tongues awake
Let all that breathe partake
Let rocks their silence break
The sound prolong
Our Father God to, Thee
Author of liberty
To Thee I sing
My country 'tis of Thee
Sweet land of liberty
For all eternity
Let freedom ring
Let freedom ring
My country 'tis, my country 'tis of Thee"
758,My Dear Companion,Dolly Parton,"Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me
I hear he's gone to come far country
And that he cares no more for me
I wish I were a swallow flying
I'd fly to a high and lonesome place
I'd join the wild birds in their crying
Thinking of you and your sweet face
Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me
But now the stars have turned against me
And he cares no more for me
Oh when the dark is on the mountain
And all the world has gone to sleep
I will go down to the cold waters
And there I'll lay me down and weep
Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me"

762,My Hands Are Tied,Dolly Parton,"To be with you is what I want more than anything
But I must share my life with the one who wears my ring
And there are tiny places I look into each night
I love you but my hands are tied
I know how much they need you and dear I understand
I know you'll never leave them cause you're not that kind of man
But I can't control my feelings though heaven knows I tried
And I love you but my hands are tied
My hands are tied and I can't break the ties that bind
I love you more than life but you never will be mine
I know how much you want me I can see it in your eyes
And I love you but my hands are tied

My hands are tied and I can't break the ties that bind...
Yes I love you but my hands are tied"
763,My Kind Of Man,Dolly Parton,"If I'm not your kind of woman
Being just the way I am
Then I know you're really not
My kind of man
I don't believe you have the right
To ask me to be different
Either take me like I am
Or let me be
If you really love me
I mean, really loved or love me
You wouldn't want to change
One part of me
If you can't be satisfied with me
The way I am
If I can't make you happy
Find someone who can
If I'm not your kind of woman
Being just the way I am
Then I know you're really
Not my kind of man
I couldn't make you happy
If I let you change me
For I know you wouldn't love me
That-a way
I can only be myself
But if you want something else
Then I can see no reason
I should stay
If you can't be satisfied with me
The way I am
If I can't make you happy
Find someone who can
If I'm not your kind of woman
Being just the way I am
Then I know you're really
Not my kind of man
If I'm not your kind of woman
Being just the way I am
Then I know you're really
Not my kind of man"
764,My Tennessee Mountain Home,Dolly Parton,"Sittin' on the front porch on a summer afternoon
In a straightback chair on two legs, leans against the wall
Watch the kids a' playin' with June bugs on a string
And chase the glowin' fireflies when evenin' shadows fall
In my Tennessee mountain home
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh
In my Tennessee mountain home
Crickets sing in the fields near by
Honeysuckle vine clings to the fence along the lane
Their fragrance makes the summer wind so sweet
And on a distant hilltop, an eagle spreads it's wings
An' a songbird on a fence post sings a melody
In my Tennessee mountain home
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh
In my Tennessee mountain home
Crickets sing in the fields near by
Walkin' home from church on a Sunday with the one ya' love
Just laughin', talkin', making future plans
And when the folks ain't lookin', you might steal a kiss or two
Sittin' in the porch swing, holdin' hands
In my Tennessee mountain home
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh
In my Tennessee mountain home
Crickets sing in the fields near by"

Chorus:
I've got a never ending love for you
From now on, that's all I want to do

Feel for each other
From now on
Feel so good I can hardly stand it

766,Never Not Love You,Dolly Parton,"I may not climb that Everest
Win praise in others' eyes
I may not win the lottery
Win the Pulitzer Prize
I may not sail the ocean
In a blown apart canoe
But I will never, never not love you
I might not be in fashion
Might not be all that smart
Might not be that good lookin'
Not someone set apart
Might not stand in the spotlight
That shines upon the pew
But I will never, never not love you
I will never not
Light up when I see you
I will never not
Feel you through and through
There are many things
I may or may not do
But I will never, never not love you
I may not offer riches
Or make a bed to do
I may not give you many things
That you're accustomed to
I may not be worthy of you
I just hope my love will
Cause I will never, never not love you
No matter where you are
No matter what you do
I will not be caught
Not loving you
May not set world records
But I can promise you
That I will never, never not love
You
No I will never, never not love you"
767,Nickels And Dimes,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton/Floyd Parton)
I used to stand on a corner when I was a child
And I'd play my guitar and sing as the people went by
The sidewalks were crowded but I'd just sing louder cause I didn't mind
Just spending my time, spinning my rhymes and singing for nickels and dimes
Nickels and dimes a song at a time for nickels and dimes
I'd brighten their day as they go on their way and they'd brighten mine
A sidewalk rehearsal for dreams that I held in my mind
I knew that someday in my own special I'd repay all their nickels and dimes
I recall the sidewalk each night as I stand on the stage
As I play my guitar and sing for the people who paid
Cause I finally made it to what they all call the big time
But I still remember I still owe some nickels and dimes
Nickels and dimes a song at a time for nickels and dimes
A sidewalk rehearsal for dreams that I held in my mind
So if you remember a child on the corner of time
You'll know that I wrote this to repay your nickels and dimes
Nickels and dimes a song at a time for nickels and dimes
A sidewalk rehearsal for dreams that I held in my mind
So if you remember a child on a corner of time
You'll know that I wrote this to repay your nickels and dimes
Nickels and dimes a song at a time for nickels and dimes
A sidewalk rehearsal for dreams that I held in my mind
So if you remember a child on a corner of time
You'll know that I wrote this to repay your nickels and dimes"

770,No Good Way Of Saying Good Bye,Dolly Parton,"The truth is too painful

I'll ever spend will be tonight

771,No Love Left,Dolly Parton,"There's no love left our love's beyond help
Why do we keep on tryin' when there's no love left
The feeling we felt for each other
For a long time now has been dying
We'd both be better off without each other
We can't bring it back to life why do we keep trying
There's no love left...

When love is gone it's gone and you can't bring it back
When the warm sun goes down it turns cold
We both might as well just accept the fact
There's nothing warm left for us to hold
There's no love left...
There's no love left..."

Writer Dolly Parton
Copyright 1969
There is no love and there is no hate there is no feeling at all
I look at you and you look at me but we might as well stare at the wall
Cause you don't see me and I don't see you just the shadow of love that is gone
There is no love and there is no hate no reason to hurry home
There's no tiny hands to reach out to us no plans bein' made anymore
We have no tomorrow our future is gone there is only sadness in store
We don't care enough to even ask questions
And when we're together we still feel alone
There is no love and there is no hate no reason to hurry home
There is nothing to look forward to no reason to hurry home"

774,Not For Me,Dolly Parton,"
Birds sing for everyone but me, for me it rains
And I can't hear the music for the pain
I see such happiness for some, but not for me

With love, I always try so hard to get it right
I find it gone just when I think I might
Regretfully I see it last for some, but not for me
Out of reach of all the things I want to have and hold
I've come to just accept that's how it goes
I've come so close
Not for me, it's not for me to question, I suppose
But I keep wondering what the future holds
Why must it be?
That life's so sweet for some, but not for me

Birds sing for everyone but me, for me it rains
And I can't see the sunshine for the pain
But I see such happiness for some, but not for me

For me it rains, there's only pain
It's not for me"
775,O Little Town Of Bethlehem,Dolly Parton,"O little town of Bethlehem,
How still we see the lie!
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by;
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee to-night.
For Christ is born of Mary,
And gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth!
And praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth.
How silently, how silently,
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of his heaven.
No ear may hear his coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive him, still
The dear Christ enters in.
Where children pure and happy
Pray to the blessed Child,
Where misery cries out to thee,
Son of the mother mild;
Where charity stands watching
And faith holds wide the door,
The dark night wakes, the glory breaks,
And Christmas comes once more.
O holy Child of Bethlehem!
Descend to us, we pray;
Cast out our sin and enter in,
Be born in us to-day.
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell;
O come to us, abide with us,
Our Lord Emmanuel!"
776,Oh Hes Everywhere,Dolly Parton,"He walks in my mind like a shadow
Someone speaks his name and he appears
I can see his face in total darkness
Oh, he's everywhere
He left a memory that lives with me
A memory of how it used to be
And I remember all the things we used to share
Oh, he's everywhere
He waits in the corners of my mind
And in the stillness of the night, he walks around
Sometimes his memory's so real I think he's really there
Oh, he's everywhere
He left a memory that lives with me
A memory of how it used to be
I remember all the things we used to share
Oh, he's everywhere
Oh, he's everywhere"
777,Old Black Kettle,Dolly Parton,"Well I remember when I was just little
Mama used to cook on an old black kettle
On an old wood stove she'd had since she was wed
Well the oven door was sprung a little bit
So we propped it up with a forked stick
But that didn't matter cause Mama kept us fed
My mama and daddy must have loved each other
Cause I had eleven sisters and brothers
And the girls worked just as hard as the boys did
There was corn to hoe then we'd go hoe it
We might have been poor but we didn't know it
We'd heard that word but we didn't know what it meant
Oh we used to have such a good life
And the days that I knew then are the happiest I've known
And oh didn't we have such a good time
It's sad to think the old black kettle's gone
Well there was nothing that pleased us any better
Than when we got an occasional letter
From kin folks livin' up north in some big town
We'd think of all the games we'd play
And we just couldn't hardly wait
When our city cousins said they'ze a comin' down
Now Mama's done away with the old black kettle
She used to cook in when I was just little
And the door ain't sprung on her electric range
That little farm and home we had
It ain't there no more and that's too bad
Folks are doin' away with the simple things
And oh we used to have such a good life
And the days that I knew then are the happiest I've known
And oh didn't we have such a good time
It's sad to think the old black kettle's gone
Now, I just mean to say the simple things are gone
The old black kettle's gone"
778,Old Flames Cant Hold A Candle To You,Dolly Parton,"Downtown tonight, I saw an old friend someone who
I used to take comfort from, long before I met you
I caught a spark from his (D7)eyes a forgotten desire
With a word or a touch, I could have rekindled that fire
But old flames, can't hold a candle to you
no one can light up the night like you do
Flickering embers of love, I've known one or two
But old flames, can't hold a candle to you
Sometimes at night I think of old lovers I've known
I remember how holding them, helped me not feel so alone
Then I feel you beside me and even their memories are gone
Like stars in the night, lost in the sweet light of dawn
But old flames, can't hold a candle to you
no one can light up the night like you do
Flickering embers of love, I've known one or two
But old flames, can't hold a candle to you"
779,On And On,Dolly Parton,"How long will you love me how long will you stay by my side
Will it be for a lifetime or just for a while
From now on yes on and on
If you will love and stand by me I'll give all my love to you
That's the way that it will be from now on yes on and on
From now on yes on and on from now on yes on and on
Love for each other that will stand the test of time
From now on on and on
I'll stand by you right or wrong then we'll always be as one
Like the robin needs his song I need you from now on
Like the rose loves the vine like the poem needs to rhyme
My love is yours and yours is mine from now on on and on
From now on yes on and on...
From now on on and on"
780,On My Mind Again,Dolly Parton,"I try hard to forget you and the love I once shared with you
But my mind won't let forgetfulness come in
There's no use in pretending. The hurt is just beginning
Just when I think it's ending you're on my mind again
On my mind again, just like you've always been
On my mind with memories I'm rememberin'
On my mind again, just like you've always been
Yes, I find I've got you on my mind again
Sometimes I go to places where certain things erases
All traces of your memory, now and then
Oh, then something will remind me of the love I left behind me
Then again, your memory finds me and you're on my mind again
On my mind again, just like you've always been
On my mind with memories I'm rememberin'
On my mind again, just like you've always been
Yes, I find I've got you on my mind again
Yes, I find I've got you on my mind again
On my mind again"

You were just checkin' if I was okay 
And if I still miss you 
Well you know what they say 
Just once in a very blue moon 
Just once in a very blue moon 
Just once in a very blue moon 
And I feel one comin' on soon 
No need to tell me you'd like to be friends 
And help me get back on my feet again

Just once in a very blue moon 
Just once in a very blue moon

Such a blue moon shinin' 
Does it ever shine down on you? 
Oh, 'cause you act like 
It never even hurt you at all 
And I'm the only one 
Gettin' up from a fall 
Tell me you dont feel it

Just once in a very blue moon 
And I feel one comin' on soon"
782,Once More,Dolly Parton,"Once more to be with you dear
Just for tonight to hold you tight
Once more I'd give a fortune
If I could see you once more.
Forget the past this hurt can't last
So I don't want it to keep us apart
Your love I need say you'll love me
And say you'll give me all of your heart.
Once more to be with you dear

Once more I'd give a fortune
If I could see you once more.

Miscellaneous
Once Upon A Christmas
Once upon a christmas far away in bethlehem
Mary being great with child had no place to lie down
So joseph found a stable in which mary had her child
Once upon a christmas was the birth of jesus christ
Once upon a christmas in a manger far away
A king was born his palace was a manger filled with hay
His royal robe was swaddling cloth a halo was his crown
Once upon a christmas away in bethlehem
And all the world rejoiced because the king was born at last
A savior had been promised now it had come to pass
And the joyful news that he was born spread quickly far and wide
Once upon a christmas was the birth of jesus christ
Once upon a christmas from the far east wise men came
With gold and myrrh and frankincense to praise the newborn king
And shepherds left their flocks and came to see and worship him
Once upon a christmas away in bethlehem
And all the world rejoiced because the king was born at last
A savior had been promised now it had come to pass
And the joyful news that he was born spread quickly far and wide
Once upon a christmas was the birth of jesus christ
Once upon a christmas far away in bethlehem"
784,Once Upon A Memory,Dolly Parton,"Once upon a memory
I kissed lips as sweet as honey
And lived in Heaven with an angel
For a little while
I knew love sweet and tender
In a world of perfect splendor
Once upon a memory
Before he said goodbye
Once upon a memory
In Never-Neverland
I had a love I know I'll
Never ever have again
A love like those
You read in fairy tales
Filled with joy and laughter
Oh, but he ended it
And it broke my heart
And I've cried forever-after
Once upon a memory
I knew love beyond compare
Oh, then his sweet lips
Lost their sweetness
And all that Heaven in his eyes
Turned into a cold and distant stare
Gone is the love, sweet and tender
A world of heartache knows no splendor
Oh, but once, once upon a memory
I knew love beyond compare
Yes, once upon a memory
In Never-Neverland
I had a love I know I'll
Never ever have again
A love like those
You read in fairy tales
Filled with joy and laughter
But he ended it
And it broke my heart
And I've cried forever-after
Oh, but once, once upon a memory
I knew love beyond compare
That was once upon a memory"
785,One Day At A Time,Dolly Parton,"Life has dealt us our fair share of pain along the way
And many dreams have withered on the vine
But dreams are all such fleeting things and happiness is now
We'll just live our lives one day at a time
In all the stormy weather love has always seen us through
Happiness is knowing that you're mine
Why worry about tomorrow for tomorrow may not come
We'll just live our lives one day at a time
This one thing I'm learning you take life as it comes
Each day is just a gift so don't be blind
Tomorrow may bring gladness or a little bit of sadness
We'll just live our lives one day at a time

We may not have a fortune making plans to change the world
We may leave little marks in life's design
But as long as we're together every hour is filled with love
And we'll just live our lives one day at a time
Just one thing I'm learning...
We'll just live our lives one day at a time"
786,One Emotion After Another,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
It's just one emotion after another
They will dress themselves as angels and theives
They will make you believe you're in heaven
Then they'll drag you through hell on your knees
It's just one emotion after another
One day I'm up just as high as it goes
Next day I'm down to the lowest of lows
I do love you baby but we can't get along
With or without each other it's al right or it's all wrong
It's hard to determine where the balance should be
We swear It's forever while we're packing to leave
Each time we end it I swear never again
But the minute you come knockin' I can't wait to let you in
It's just one emotion after another
They will dress themselves as angels and theives
They will make you believe you're in heaven
Then they'll drag you through hell on your knees
It's just one emotion after another
It's been that way since lovim' began
Like an ocean love flows with it's highs and it's lows
Like the tide it just goes out and in
It's just one emotion after another
It's just one emotion after another
But I guess that's just the way that it goes
Love is rainbow and rain, Love is pleasure and pain
I cannot stay the same I suppose
But I love you and that's all I know"
787,One Of Those Days,Dolly Parton,"It's been one of those days
That reminded me in many ways
Of when we were happy, still in love
Just a certain way the wind blows
Just a certain way the sun glows
It's been one of those days that reminded me of us
And even though it's over I never will get over
These feelings that I get on certain days
And I know I'll always love you
And I'll always be thinkin' of you
In certain kinds of ways, on certain kinds of days
And today well, it's been one of those days
It's been one of those days and my heart feels so heavy
And my mind is so full of thoughts of you
It's been one of those days and I'd give my life to see you
And to once more know the love that we once knew
And even though it's over I never will get over
Oh these feelings that I get on certain days
I guess I know I'll always love you
And I'll always be thinkin' of you
In certain kinds of ways, on certain kinds of days
And today well, it's been one of, one of those days
It's been one of those days
That reminded me in many ways
Of when we were happy, still in love"
788,Only Dreamin,Dolly Parton,"Oh I know, I'm only dreaming.
'Cause I'll awake, and you'll be gone.
And my tears will still be streaming.
As my broken, heart beats on.
Yes I know, I'm only dreaming.
But I'll just, keep dreaming on.
I will dream about the pleasures.
That we shared in days gone by.
And I'll remember and I'll treasure,
Every kiss and your kind eyes.
And I will dream that you still hold me,
In your arms as you did then.
And I recall each thing you told me,
Hear your voice as I did then.
Yes I know, I'm only dreaming.
But I'll dream, and I will too.
I'll be here, and I'll be waiting,
And I will dream, of your return.
Some will say I'm being foolish,
While some will say that I'm just blind.
And that I want to face what the truth is
That you are, no longer mine.
But I will dream, your brave stallion
To some sweet day, to their surprise.
You will say your love's still burning,
You'll dry each tear drop from my eyes.
But I know, I'm only dreaming,
Cause I'll awake and be alone.
And my tears will still be streaming,
And you will still be just as gone.
Yes I know I'm only dreaming,
But I must keep dreaming, on"

Comin' down that railroad track
Hey, look a-yonder comin'
Comin' down that railroad track
It's the Orange Blossom Special
Bringin' my baby back
Well, I'm going down to Florida
And get some sand in my shoes
Or maybe Californy
And get some sand in my shoes
I'll ride that Orange Blossom Special
And lose these New York blues
""Say man, when you going back to Florida?""
""When am I goin' back to Florida? I don't know, don't reckon I ever will.""
""Ain't you worried about getting your nourishment in New York?""
""Well, I don't care if I do-die-do-die-do-die-do-die.""

Knowin' you'll welcome me in.
Don't have to knock twice, it feels so right
Bein' here with you again.
Might not be the right thing to do
But I swear it doesn't feel wrong.
Might not be forever, but never say never,
I'm standin' outside of your door.
I guess I should feel cheap,
But I just can't keep
My mind and my hands off of you.
The way we make love
Is so far above
Anything I ever knew.
So here I am, I'm outside your door,
Knowin' what's waitin' inside.
Heaven on earth and for all that it's worth,
We'll be here til we're both satisfied.
Two bottles of wine, one white and one red,
Few drinks to unwind, and then be off to bed.
We can't fight this passion, no need to pretend
And oh yes, I'll be outside your door again.
Darlin', I'm outside your door,
And I know you welcome me in.
(Don't have to knock twice)
It feels so right
Just bein' here with you again.
Yeah, I'm standin' outside of your door (once more)
And I know you'll welcome me in.
Don't have to knock twice, it feels so right,
Standin' outside of your door, once more.

Once more.

792,Packin It Up,Dolly Parton,"I'm watching the clock, it says five to five
The minutes are ticking so slow
I'm ready to stop, gonna close up the shop
So honey if you're ready lets go
Take out your pinstripe suit
And your fancy cowboy boots
Now ain't it a crime when you're lookin' so fine
And tonight you're mine, all mine

Packin' it up, movin' on out
Headed up to the big town
Sure like them big city lights on a Saturday night
Coming in from the country
Second Chorus:
Packin it up, movin' on out
Headed up to the big town
Sure like those big city lights on a Saturday night
Coming in from the country
Take off my blue jeans
Slip on the hottest dress that you've ever seen
Just like an ad in a fashion magazine
It's you and me babe, a sight for sore eyes to see
Take in a movie or maybe a show
Dance all night just letting it go
Champagne and roses waiting back at our suite
So kick off your boots and make sweet love to me
Repeat Second Chorus 3X
Repeat Second Chorus To Fade"
793,Paradise Road,Dolly Parton,"I grew up dirty and I grew up poor
The wolf didn't even hang 'round our door
Not a crumb to spare and the cupboard bare
And I had the gift of imagination
I could change my situation
Anytime I choose I could always go
Down Paradise Road
I found a kingdom deep within
A place dream and to pretend
And to prepare for the world out there
A dream can dress you when you're ragged
Fill you up when hunger's naggin'
I warmed my soul when life was cold
On Paradise Road
Chorus:
Paradise is a state of mind
The sun shines warm and all the time
And the rain don't flow and the wind don't blow
On Paradise Road
A place no one can take from me
A place of everlasting peace
Where dreamers go; It's never closed
Paradise Road
Paradise is a state of mind
Down the road of life and time
And the friends we meet
Make the travlin' sweet
On Paradise Road
Sometimes now when the world is mad
I find that place I've always had
Inside my soul; It's paved in gold
Paradise Road
I grew up dirty and I grew up poor
The wolf didn't even hang 'round our door
Not a crumb to spare and the cupboard bare
But I had the gift of imagination
I could change my situation
Anytime I choose I could always go
Down Paradise Road"

Thinking about the good things to come
And I believe it could be

795,Pleasant As May,Dolly Parton,"The midsummer sun shines but dim
The fields try in vain to look gay
But when I was happy with him
December was pleasant as May
There once was a time he and I
Picked flowers to braid in my hair
And the songbirds would sing a sweet song
Of love that was tender and fair
No difference did seasons make when
Our love was as warm as the sun
And it mattered not whether the snow
Or the green grass kissed the fields where we'd run
Now the midsummer sun shines but dim
The fields try in vain to look gay
But when I was happy with him
December was pleasant as May
Sweet flowers, sweet birds and sweet songs
Have now lost their sweetness to me
Forever my darling is gone
And forever heartbroken are we
Now the midsummer sun shines but dim
The fields try in vain to look gay
But when I was happy with him
December was pleasant as May
The midsummer sun shines but dim"

And when I'm in darkness, you bring me the light 
You opened my eyes when I couldn't see

799,Pms Blues,Dolly Parton,"Eve you wicked woman, you done put your curse on me
Why didn't you just leave that apple hangin' in the tree
You make us hate our husbands, our lovers and our boss
Why I can't even count the good friends I've already lost
Cause of pms blues, pms blues
I don't even like myself, but it's something I can't help
I got those God almighty, slap somebody pms blues
Most times I'm easy going, some say I'm good as gold
But when I'm pms I tell ya, I turn mean and cold
Those not afflicted with it are affected just the same
You poor old men didn't have to grin and say I feel your pain
Pms blues, pms blues
You know you must forgive us for we care not what we do
I got those can't stop crying, dishes flying pms blues
But you know we can't help it
We don't even know the cause
But as soon as this part's over, then comes the menopause
Oh, lord, oh, lord
We're going to always be a heap of fun
Like the devil taking over my body, suffering, suffering, suffering
Everybody's suffering, huh?
But a woman had to write this song, a man would be scared to
Lest he be called a chauvenist or just fall victim to
Those pms blues
You know we'd kill for less than that
Pms blues
You don't want to cross my path
Cause a pitbull ain't no match
For these teeth a clenchin', fluid retention
Head a swellin', can't stop yellin'
Got no patience, I'm so hateful
Pms blues, premenstrual syndrome
Got those moods a swingin', tears a slingin'
Nothin' fits me when it hits me
Rantin', ravin', misbehavin'
Pms blues
It's the only time in my life I ever think about wishing I'd been a man
But you know that only means one thing
If I'd have been a man, I'd be somewhere right this very minute
With some old cranky, naggin', raggin' hateful woman
With those old pms blues
Pms blues
I don't want to talk about it, we both could do without it
Got those treat your kids bad, don't you talk back
Gone ballistic, unrealistic
Awful lowdown, bitch to be around
Pms blues"

Just a place to watch our children grow
We got no big fine fancy car to drive
And no fancy clothes to keep in style
What we've got we're payin' on
But it's mostly love that we're livin' on
So, come on down

Rich folks livin' in a poor folks town
We got no money but we're rich in love
That's one thing that we've got a-plenty of

And the promise of a mansion in the sky
A heart of gold a million dollar smile
And a one way ticket to paradise

About possum in Possum Holler
As a young man I'd go a courtin'
With my sweetheeart so young and fair
Down the mountain to Possum Holler
That's where he'd always find me waitin' there
Now I tell my mama that I's goin' out walking
Neath the moonlight so bright and fair
And I'd tell daddy I was huntin' possum
And take off a grinnin' and a slickin' down my hair
As time goes by the tales grow taller
About possum in Possum Holler
Then one evening in Possum Holler
My sweetheart's daddy stopped all our fun
Yeah we got married in Possum Holler
Just you and me my daddy and daddy's gun
As time goes by the tales grow taller
About possum in Possum Holler
Now when they see a possum hunter
Young and handsome and a smellin' fair
We just lean back and bust our laughin'
Cause we know there ain't no possum there
As time goes by the tales grow taller
About possum in Possum Holler
About possum in Possum Holler"

He's all your's
Until then

803,Preacher Tom,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
You know I grew up way back up in the country
Where religion played a big part in my life
I remember all day singings tent revivals and the old brush arbor meetings
And the old country preachers that used to spread the gospel
Throughout our part of country.
Well, time went on and seemed like everything got so sophisticated
That the old time country preacher seemed to be a thing of the past
Well, that's what I thought till not long ago when I met a man that rerminded me
Of all the little country preachers I'd ever know.
And I wanted to write a song about him
So preacher Tom wherever you may be
I want you to know that I wrote this song for you
And reach on preacher Tom preach on.
Preacher Tom your friends are many and your good deeds are a plenty
And I know that God is pretty proud of you
'Cause you've directed your attention toward a bright and shining mansion
God promised to the one that pay the dues.
So preacher Tom come on preach, let the one of which you speak
Have his way let his precious will be done
Preacher Tom come and teach of the one always in reach
Saying whosever and we'll let him come
Reach out preacher, Tom preach on, preach on, preacher Tom preach on.
Your smile is like the sunshine bringing warmth and joy to others
And love controls your understanding heart
And the message that you spread is just like water to the thirsty
A beacon that keeps shining through the dark.
So preacher Tom come on preach, let the one of which you speak
Have his way let his precious will be done
Preacher Tom come and teach of the one always in reach
Saying whosever and we'll let him come
Reach out preacher, Tom preach on, preach on, preacher Tom preach on.
Preacher Tom come on preach, let the one of which you speak
Have his way let his precious will be done
Preacher Tom come and teach of the one always in reach
Saying whosever and we'll let him come
Reach out preacher, Tom preach on, preach on, preacher Tom preach on.
So preacher Tom come on preach, let the one of which you speak
Have his way let his precious will be done
Preacher Tom come and teach of the one always in reach
Saying whosever and we'll let him come
Reach out preacher, Tom preach on, preach on, preacher Tom preach on..."
804,Precious Memories,Dolly Parton,"Precious memories, unseen angels
Sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger ever near me
And the sacred scenes unfold
Precious father, loving mother
Fly across the lonely years
And those old home scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appear
Precious memories
How they linger
How they ever flood my soul

Then, the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold
Precious memories
How they linger
How they ever flood my soul
Then, the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold
Precious memories"
805,Prime Of Our Love,Dolly Parton,"I have rocked you to sleep like a baby
Stood beneath you and lifted you up
I have given you comfort and safety
Now you've gone in the prime of our love
I have cradled your head on my pillow
Quenched your thirst from my sweet loving cup
I have bowed to your needs like a willow
Now you've gone in the prime of our love
Oh, the days are slow in their passing
And the nights are so dreadfully dull
And the question my heart keeps on asking
Why'd you leave in the prime of our love?
I have cradled your head on my pillow
Quenched your thirst from my sweet loving cup
I have bowed to your needs like a willow
Now you've gone in the prime of our love
In the prime of our love you've forsaken
Our bright hopes and just left them to fade
And the heart that was yours for the breaking
Lies in pieces to wither away
I have cradled your head on my pillow
Quenched your thirst from my sweet loving cup
I have bowed to your needs like a willow
Now you've gone in the prime of our love
In the prime of our love you've forsaken
Our bright hopes and just left them to fade
And the heart that was yours for the breaking
Lies in pieces to wither away
Lies in pieces as cold as the clay"
806,Pure And Simple,Dolly Parton,"Every time I think about you
I get chills along my spine
It's a feeling I'm not used to,
Can't believe you're really mine
Other love's so complicated
Broken hearts and twisting minds
Then you came and I'm elated
So unlike the other times
It's so pure it's almost sacred.
Simply put, it feels divine.
I just love you pure and simple,
pure and simple and sublime.
Don't it seem we have spent a lifetime
Looking for that perfect love
Like a dream we finally found it
Pure and simple
Well, good for us
It's so pure it's almost sacred
Simply put, it feels divine
I just love you pure and simple
pure and simple, sweet and fine
I just love you pure and simple
Can't believe you're really mine
Pure and simple..."

You've hurt me enough today
You say our love is over
That you have found another
You say you're going away
But leave me tomorrow

But I must accept the fact
You won't be coming back

Stay just one more day
Loneliness isn't far away
Put it off until tomorrow

You've hurt me enough today
Put it off until tomorrow

You've hurt me enough today"
810,Queen Of The Tabloids,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
Chorus:
I'm the queen of the sleazy tabloids
I rule the trashy kingdom
Like Lady Di they make sure I am never left alone
Papparazzi and reporters stalk me from the shadows
Making sure to keep my royal assetts on my throne
Oh they talk about the lovers
That I keep undercover
And I wish that I was as much fun
As they have you believe
Just like Alec Baldwin
I'd love to whack 'em all one
But instead I'll wait and see
Who I am sleepin' with next week
I'm the queen of the sleazy tabloids
And I rule the trashy kingdom
But the rumors raise my cue score
And pay for my big home
I guess I 'augt to sue them
But instead I guess I'll use them
To keep me in the spotlight
And keep me on my throne
Cause I'm the queen of the sleazy tabloids"
811,Ragged Angel,Dolly Parton,"Cindy was a ragged angel just a poor little girl on the street
Cindy's eyes showed signs of hunger never had enough to eat
Cindy was a ragged angel golden hair and eyes of blue
Cindy loved her paper dolly that's the only love she knew
Cindy never knew her daddy and her mommie was seldom home
Except for Cindy's paper dolly Cindy was all alone
Cindy slept with her paper dolly on a blanket on the floor
She would shiver as the wind blew through the crack beneath the door
One night she laid with her paper dolly cold and hungry on the floor
That night God came for the ragged angel
And now Cindy won't ever be cold and hungry no not anymore
Ragged angel"
812,Randy,Dolly Parton,"Randy in your eyes, I see the promise of a future
The promise of a love like I have never known
Randy, cradled in your arms, I feel like I'm in heaven
And heaven knows I've needed someone like you for so long
So Randy take me with you, for that's where I want to be
Teach me how to fly on these new wings you've given me
Randy, let me show you what your love has meant to me
Randy, let me be the only one you'll ever need
Randy, you have given me reason to live again
Reason to love again and reason to smile
Randy, you have given me new inspiration
New dreams to dream and a reason to try
So Randy take me with you for that's where I want to be
Teach me how to fly on these new wings you've given me
Randy, let me show you what your love has meant to me
Randy, let me be the only one you'll ever need"
813,Real Love,Dolly Parton,"They say that it's a matter of trusting
Before love has a chance to begin
And it's never simple
Faithless hearts can cripple
And only a strong love survives
I know they say that it's a fine line
Between giving up and giving in
But once your heart's been in it
You just can't forget it
It's like nothing that you've felt in your life
We got real love
Not infatuation
Real love
Our hearts' celebration
I love you
Real love
Not an imitation
Real love
You're my destination
Baby, you and me
We got everything we need
You are such a part of my life
That I can't remember me without you
And we've had our nights
We've had our share of fights
But we've never thought of giving it up
Oh, you and I we must be dreamers
'Cause we're making our dreams come true
I could spend my life
Just holding you so tight
And never, ever get enough
We got real love
Not infatuation
Real love
Our hearts' celebration
I love you
Real love

814,Red Hot Screaming Love,Dolly Parton,"I can't even begin to tell you
How I've been feelin' lately
But I have stumbled across something rare
And you use it to bait me
Something tells me go
Everyone says no, no, no
How can they be so cruel
When they tell me don't touch you
I tell them I'll die
In your red hot screaming love
In your red hot screaming love
If I'm losing my senses
They're lost in your deepest emotions
And the jets in my heart
They won't start till you set them in motion
Something tells me go
Everyone says no, no, no
How can they be so cruel
When they tell me don't touch you
I tell them I'll die
In your red hot screaming love
In your red hot screaming love"
815,Release Me,Dolly Parton,"Please release me, let me go
'Cause I don't love you anymore
And to live without love is a sin
So release me and let me love again
I have found a new love, dear
And I'll always want him near
His lips are warm while yours are cold
So release me, my darlin' let me go
Oh please release me, let me go
'Cause I just won't love you anymore
And to live together we both know is a sin
So release me, release me and let me love again
Oh, please, please, please, please
Release me, let me go
'Cause I, I don't love you anymore
And to live together is a sin
So release me and let me love again
Oh, please release me, let me go
I don't love you anymore
And to live together is a sin
So release me and let me love again"
816,Rhumba Girl,Dolly Parton,"Writer Jesse Winchester
I'm the same old girl that I used to be
I haven't changed at all
I got the same old walk and the same old talk
That would run you up the wall
The same old face and the same old smile and
The same old baby blues
And I'm still doing the rhumba, baby
So I'm still the girl for you
I'm still doing the rhumba baby
I can't seem to quit
If my mama catches us doing the rhumba
Mama would just pitch a fit
But I can't help myself, it's much bigger than me
If I were you, I'd hang onto a rhumba girl like me
There's lots of girls on the floor tonight
With a lot slicker steps than me
The boogaloo and the funky broadway
Are such a pretty sight to see
My step might be old fashioned
But it's just fine with me
I got a couple of rhumba steps
You might like to see
I'm still doing the rhumba baby
I can't seem to quit
If my mama catches us doing the rhumba
Mama would just pitch a fit
But I can't help myself, it's much bigger than me
If I were you, I'd hang onto a rhumba girl like me"
817,River Of Happiness,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
Somewhere a river of happiness flows 
We'll sit on its banks while the warm breezes blow 
Somewhere there's a garden where only love grows 
Somewhere a river of happiness flows 
Dry your eyes, don't cry no more 
We'll find a place where there's laughter and joy 
So take my hand and don't let go 
Come with me and together we'll go 
Somewhere a river of happiness flows 
We'll sit on its banks while the warm breezes blow 
Somewhere there's a garden where only love grows 
Somewhere a river of happiness flows 
We'll walk in the sunshine 
We'll laugh and we'll sing 
And dance to the tune that our happiness brings 
Come go with me to this place I speak of 
Together, we'll find it, this place is called love 
Somewhere a river of happiness flows 
We'll sit on its banks while the warm breezes blow 
Somewhere there's a garden where only love grows 
Somewhere a river of happiness flows 
Somewhere a river of happiness flows"
818,Robert,Dolly Parton,"Robert's appearance is something to behold
Dressed in the finest of store bought clothes
My mamma sews my clothes cause I'm just a poor girl
But Robert is as real as his daddies gold
Robert could have any girl that he wanted
But his feelings for me each day seems to grow
He don't know the reason, that he's so drawn to me
But there is a story that Robert doesn't know
Oh Robert
Oh Robert
Robert is constantly making eyes at me
He misunderstands the feelings we share
There's no way that I can return his glances
But I know the meaning of the feeling that's there
Robert if you knew, there once was a rich boy
In love with a poor girl, long time ago
But the folks of that rich boy, would not let them marry
And I am a symbol of the love that they stole
Oh Robert
Oh Robert
Robert, oh Robert if you only knew
The same blood is flowing in both me and you
That rich boy's your father, but he's also mine
And my mamma's the poor girl that he left behind
Oh Robert
Oh Robert"

Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Lay around the shack 'til the mail comes back
And I'll roll in my sweet baby's arms
I ain't gonna work on the railroad
I ain't gonna work on the farm
Lay down the shack 'til the mail train comes back
And I'll roll in my sweet baby's arms
Now where were you last Friday night
While I was lying in jail
Walking the streets with another man
Wouldn't even go my bail
I know you parents don't like me
They drove me away from your door
If I had my life to live over
I'd never go there any more"

Comet and Cupid and Donder and Blitzen
But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all
(Rudolph) that's right Rudolph
He was the one with the big red nose that everyone make fun of
Everyone there is except Santa
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it why you would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names
They'd never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games
Until one foggy Christmas Eve Santa came to say
Hey Rudolph with your nose so bright won't you guide my sleigh tonight
Then how the reindeer loved him as they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer you'll go down in history
Then one foggy Christmas Eve...

I ain't felt like this since I'ze a kid 
And I never thought I'd feel this much again 
I've got that runaway feelin' 
Like to grab you up 
Just run off, footloose and fancy free 
Yeah, that thought's appealing 
That runaway feelin's let my feelin's run away with me 
I get all swimmy-headed everytime I look at you 
Though love has blurred my vision, I still enjoy the view 
Like Elvis and his hound dog, in a deep fog 
I keep a'runnin' after you 
I thought I'd been in love before 
But before doesn't matter anymore 
I've got that runaway feelin' 
Like to grab you up

825,Sacred Memories,Dolly Parton,"Sacred memories often take me
To the place where I grew up
And that little country church
That I loved so much
I used to go there everytime
That old church bell would ring
And I remember how I loved the songs we used to sing
Like ""Oh Lord d'you know
I have no friend like you
If heaven's not my home
Then Lord what will I do?
The angels beckon me from heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore
They were singin' ""Lord I'm Comin Home""
When I got saved
And when I got baptised they sang ""Amazing Grace""
And oh how sweet the sound when everybody would join in
And sing my favourite song, ""If We Never Meet Again""
Where the charming roses bloom
Forever
And when separation comes no more
If we never meet again
This side of heaven
I will meet you on that beautiful shore
My Mama loved to sing
And she sang clear and loud
I can close my eyes and I hear Mama now
I recall a song my Mama always loved so much
She always sang the loudest singin' ""Power In The Blood""
Oh there's power
Power
Wonder workin' power
In the blood
Of the lamb
There is power
Power
Wonder workin' power
In the precious blood of the lambs

830,Satans River,Dolly Parton,"Satan's got river Satan's got river deep and wide so deep and wide
Satan's got a river and it's so deep and wide
And he's got folks a swimming he's got folks a swimming
In the warm smooth tire
But some day Satan's river
Yes some day Satan's river is gonna run dry it's gonna run dry
What was once a smooth river hot lava will make the tide
Stay clear of Satan's river heaven's on either side
Big yachts are sailing Satan's river so smooth
Never stopping or thinking about God's golden rule
When the river starts to sinking they'll cry I've been a fool
Satan's got river deep and wide
Satan's got river and it's so deep and wide
And he's got folks a swimming in the warm smooth tide
Satan's got river..."
831,Satin Sheets,Dolly Parton,"Chorus:
Satin sheets to lie on
Satin pillows to cry on
Still I'm not happy don't you see
Big long Cadillacs, tailor maids upon my back
Still I want you to set me free
I've found another man
Who can give more than you can
Though you've given me everything that money can buy
But your money can't hold me tight
Like he does on a long long night
No, you didn't keep me satisfied
Repeat Chorus Twice
Tag:
Satin sheets to lie on"
832,Save The Last Dance For Me,Dolly Parton,"You can dance every dance with the one
Who gives you the eye, let him hold you tight
You can smile every smile for the one
That hold your hand in the pale moonlight
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me
Oh, I know that the music's fine
Like sparklin' wine, go and have your fun
Dance and sing but while we're apart
Don't give your heart to anyone
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me
Baby, don't you know I love you so
Can't you feel it when we touch
I'll never never let you go
I love you oh so much
You can dance, go and carry on
Till the night is gone, till it's time to go
If she asks if you're all alone
Can she take you home, you gotta tell her no
And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me
Darlin', save the last dance for me
You can dance every dance with the one
Who gives you the eye, let him hold you tight
You can smile every smile for the one
That holds your hand in the pale moonlight
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me
Darlin', save the last dance for me
The last dance for me

For someone who's as wonderful as you
Someone who's kind and always cares

You appear and I'm brand new
I love it, hey, I love it 'cause it's you

All my love, all my love, all my lovin' for tonight
I've been savin' it for you
For you, for you, for you Mister Right

834,Say Forever Youll Be Mine,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
Say forever you'll be mine 
Forever is the love that is filled with understanding 
Forever is the love that is true and undemanding 
Forever is the love that can stand the test of time 
Forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine 
Trouble clouds may fill our skies 
It might even rain awhile 
But the rain will go away 
There's always a brighter day 
Darling, I won't promise you 
That we'll be happy all the time 
But forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine 
Forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine 
Say forever you'll be mine, forever I am yours 
And I'll do anything that you ever ask me to 
And I'll do what you want me to 
Darling, I won't promise you 
That we'll be happy all the time 
But forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine"
835,Say Goodnight,Dolly Parton,"The city streets are empty, it's beginning to feel like dawn
The lights have gone out, the sun is coming on
We've been standing here for hours watching the river flow
You walked into my life tonight but if you've got to go
Say goodnight while there's still a star to wish on
Say goodnight while the moon is still in your eyes
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a while
Then say goodnight but never say goodbye
I've been saving all my secrets, spending my time alone
I've given up on the life I used to know
I've been waiting for one person to love me like a friend
You walked into my life tonight but if it's got to end
Say goodnight while there's still a star to wish on
Say goodnight while the moon is still in your eyes
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a while
Then say goodnight but never say goodbye
Oh, it's easy now to tell you how I'm dreaming 'bout tomorrow
'Cause you'll be there to share that dream with me
But now it's time to close your eyes put this night away
And keep it safe, a perfect memory
Say goodnight while there's still a star to wish on
Say goodnight while the moon is still in your eyes
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a while
Then say goodnight but never say goodbye
Oh, oh, oh
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a little while
Then say goodnight but never say goodbye
Say goodnight while there's still a star to wish on
Say goodnight while the moon is still in your eyes
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a while
Then say goodnight but don't you say goodbye
Say goodnight while there's still a star to wish on
Say goodnight while the moon is still in your eyes
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a while"
836,Second Best,Dolly Parton,"(Though I'm only second best you're still first with me)
I tried to make you love me I've done everything I could
I thought if I tried long enough maybe someday that you would
But there was someone else before me and it's her you're lovin' still
And I know no matter what I'd do I'm only second best
Only second best that's all I will ever be
Even though I'm second best you're still first with me
And I'll be loving you when they fall my hand I guess
I love you even though I know I'm only second best
I know you've tried to love me and I'd hope you would in time
I know that when you're holding me it's her that's on your mind
Now I know you can't get over her but I love you nonless
But it makes no difference what I'd do I'm only second best
Only second best...
I love you even though I know I'm only second best"
837,Send Me The Pillow That You Dream On,Dolly Parton,"Send me the pillow that you dream on
Don't you know that I still care for you
Send me the pillow that you dream on
So darling I can dream on it too
Each night while I'm sleeping oh so lonely
I pray that time will let our dreams come true
Send me the pillow that you dream on
So darling I can dream on it too
Send me the pillow, send me the pillow
Each night when I sleep I dream about you
And wish that I was dreamin' next to you
Send me the pillow that you dream on
So darling I can dream on it too
Send me the pillow that you dream on
So darling I can dream on it too
Send me the pillow you dream on
Send me the pillow, send me the pillow
Send me, send me, send me the pillow that you dream on
Send me the pillow, send me the pillow"
838,Seven Bridges Road,Dolly Parton,"
There are stars in the southern sky
Southward as you go
There is moonlight and moss in the trees
Down the seven bridges road
I have loved you like a baby
Like some lonesome child
I have loved you in a tame way
And I have loved you wild
Sometimes there is a part of me
Has to turn from here and go
Running like a child from these warm stars
Down the seven bridges road

There are stars in the southern sky
And if ever you decide you should go
There is a taste of time sweet as honey
Down the seven bridges road
There are stars in the southern sky
Southward as you go
There is moonlight and moss in the trees
Down the seven bridges road
Down the seven bridges road"
839,Shattered Image,Dolly Parton,"I used to sit for hours as a kid
And dangle my feet from an old flat bridge
Seeing myself in the water below
Shatter my image with the rocks I'd throw
Shatter my image with the rocks I'd throw
A long time gone and a long time ago
When I shattered my image with the rocks I'd throw
The world is cruel and people are cold
Now they shatter my image with the rocks they throw
Shatter my image with the rocks they throw
I'm far from perfect, but I ain't all bad
And it hurts me more than it makes me mad
We all do things that we don't want told
And we all throw stones that we shouldn't throw
You shattered my image with the rocks you throw
A long time gone and a long time ago
When I shattered my image with the rocks I'd throw
The world is cruel and people are cold
Now they shatter my image with the rocks they throw
Shatter my image with the rocks they throw
If you live in a glass house don't throw stones
Don't shatter my image 'til you look at your own
Look at your reflection in your house of glass
Don't open my closet if your own's full of trash
Stay out of my closet if your own's full of trash
A long time gone and a long time ago
When I shattered my image with the rocks I'd throw
The world is cruel and people are cold
Now they shatter my image with the rocks they throw
Shatter my image with the rocks they throw
Shatter my image with the rocks you throw
Don't shatter my image with the rocks you throw"
840,She Dont Love You Like I Love You,Dolly Parton,"She don't love you like I love you
Cause if she did she wouldn't break your heart
She don't love you like I love you
She's tryin' to tear us apart
Fairly well I know you're leavin'
For the new love that you found
The pretty girl that you've been dating
Oh I've got a feeling she's gonna put you down
Cause she don't love you like I love you
Cause if she did she wouldn't break your heart
She don't love you like I love you
She's tryin' to tear us apart
She uses all the great quotations
She says all the things I wish I could say
But she's had so many rehearsals
Oh, to her it's just a lover's play
But wait when the final act is over
And you're left standin' all alone
When she takes her bow and makes her exit
Oh, well I'll be there to take you home
She don't love you like I love you
Cause if she did she wouldn't break your heart
She don't love you like I love you
She's tryin' to tear us apart"
841,Shine,Dolly Parton,"
Give me a word, give me a sign

842,Shine Like The Sun,Dolly Parton,"I've been down on my luck,
I've been shadowed with trouble and sorrow.
But I ain't givin' up'
'Cause I know there is always tomorrow.
There are no guarantees,
Life is always a hit or miss.
But I truly believe
I won't always be feeling' like this.
I'm gonna shine like the sun
When these clouds roll away from my door.
When it's all said and done
I won't be at your mercy no more.
I will prove my own worth,
Heal the damage and hurt that's been done.
And when the cryin's all done.
Well, I'm gonna shine like the sun.
I've been thinking here lately
What all I can do to improve.
Though I've suffered greatly,
I know just what I have to do.
I have to move forward,
Cut losses, break loose and move on.
And I have to swim shoreward
Lest I should drown out here alone.
I'm gonna shine like the sun
When these clouds roll away from my door.
I won't crawl I can run
I'll be at no ones mercy no more.
I'll be swinging on sunbeams
So proud that I finally won.
And when the losin's all done.
Well, I'm gonna shine like the sun.
I'm gonna shine, I'm gonna shine.
I'm gonna shine like the sun.
When these clouds roll away from my door.
And when it's all said and done
I won't be at your mercy no more.
I'll be off chasin' rainbows,
Rejoicin' and havin' my fun.
And when the cryin's all done,
Well, I'm gonna shine like the sun.
When the cryin's all done,
When the tryin's all done,
When the lyin's all done
There'll be nothin' but sun.
When it's all said and done
Well, I'm gonna shine like the sun.
Shine like the sun, shine like the sun."
843,Shine On,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
The greatest gift, the gift of life 
The gift of love divine 
God gave us all a special gift 
He meant for it to shine 
He meant for it to shine 
The darkest night can be made light 
By one bright word or smile 
If we'd put on our neighbor's shoes 
And choose to walk a mile 
God gave us all our own free will 
To choose the paths we take 
No greater deed could e'er be done 
Than for another's sake 
The greatest gift, the gift of life 
The gift of love divine 
God gave us all a special gift 
He meant for it to shine 
He meant for it to shine 
Shine on, shine on, for all to see 
God's light inside your soul 
Shine on, shine on, let love flow free 
Warm others in its glow 
Shine on, shine on, shine on 
So hide it not or it will fade 
Shine on, shine on, shine on 
Shine on, shine on, shine on 
The greatest gift, the gift of life 
The gift of love divine 
God gave us all a special gift 
He meant for it to shine 
Shine on, shine on, shine on"
844,Shinola,Dolly Parton,"You got a snazzy new car in your driveway
Expensive new clothes on your back
Every short skirt on the highway
Has spent time in your bachelor pad
We dance and you look over my shoulder
And make eyes at somebody else
You swear that you're not, but you know that's a croc
Cause you only care for yourself
Your attitude stinks and I hate it
You're arrogant, cocky, and rude
You're selfish, conceited, and jaded
Everything's all about you
You think that I'm lucky to have you
You think you're so handsome, so what
I'm callin' you out cause I don't need this crap
I'm gettin' myself outta Dodge
Cause you don't know love from Shinola
With you love is not what I found
A woman needs someone to hold her
Not someone to just lay her down
I want someone I can count on
A cool headed, warm heart and shoulder
To cry on, rely on, today and from now on
But you don't know love from Shinola
You don't know love from Shinola
Oh but I gave you love and affection
But you never gave one iota
It was an early detection
That you don't know love from Shinola
You don't know love from shinola
You don't know what true loves about
Well you'll find your world growin' colder
When you're alone and without
So go on, lover boy, have a big time
Drink up on your Bourbon and cola
When you sober up you'll be *beep* outta luck
Cause you don't know love from Shinola
I'm in it for love, but you're just plain stuck
You don't know love from Shinola
You don't know love, you don't know love
You don't know love from Shinola
No, you don't know love from Shinola
You don't know love, you don't know love"
845,Silent Night,Dolly Parton,"Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild,
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight,
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia
Christ the Savior, is born!
Christ the Savior, is born!
Silent night, holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord, at thy birth
Jesus, Lord, at thy birth
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace"
846,Silver Dagger,Dolly Parton,"Don't sing love songs
You'll wake my mother
She's sleeping here right by my side
In her right hand is a silver dagger
She says that I can't be your bride
All men are fools
So says my mother
They'll tell you again
Love and lies
And then they'll go
And court someother
Leave you alone to pine inside
My daddy is a handsome devil
He's got a chain five miles long
On every link, a heart does dangle
Of another maid he's loved and wronged, ohhh
Go court another tender maiden
In hopes that she might be your wife
For I've been warned so I decided
I'll sleep alone all of my life, ohh...
Beware, beware, a silver dagger"
847,Silver Sandals,Dolly Parton,"In silver sandals she goes walking up those golden stairs
And though we miss her so we know she's happy to be there
She walks with us in memory we see her all the time
In silver sandals walking through our minds
So many times we let our thoughts turn back to yesterday
To a little girl that could only watch the children as they played
She walks with us in memories we see her all the time
In silver sandals walking through our minds
The grave in which she sleeps is cold but our thoughts of her are warm
And we cry as we both long to hold her in our arms
Each night in dreams we see her running to us smiling sweet
With silver sandals on her little feet
In silver sandals she goes walking...
She had asked for sandals from the time that she could talk
And it would break our hearts when she'd ask us why she couldn't walk
She'd say when I go to heaven can I change my crutches then
For a pair of silver sandals at the rainbow's end
In silver sandals she goes walking...
In silver sandals walkin' through our minds"
848,Silver Threads Golden Needles,Dolly Parton,"Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I'll never drown my sorrow
In the warm glow of your wine
You can't buy my love with money
For I never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
I don't want your golden mansions
With a tear in every room
All I want's the love you promised
Beneath the halo moon
But you think I should be happy
With your money and your name
And hide myself in sorrow
While you play your cheatin' game
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I'll never drown my sorrow
In the warm glow of your wine
You can't buy my love with money
For I never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine"
849,Sittin On The Front Porch Swing,Dolly Parton,"I remember the time when the bloom was on the cotton
When our hearts chased the clouds like the swallows on their wings
Winter cares which we're already few or soon forgotten
Just sittin' on the front porch swing
Oh we sit every Sunday and watched the married ladies
And we dreamed of white dresses and church bells in the spring
And they talked and painted their nails while they let us hold their babies
Sittin' on the front porch swing
Where was I when the time came to join the married ladies
Why did I paint the nail when the finger had no ring
Why do I sit at night at my age to hold their baby
Sittin' on the front porch swing
When the mind longs to follow but the memory erases
And the lips form the words that the heart no longer sings
When the leaves in the hollow have been died to match our faces
Sittin' on the front porch swing
Oh we'll dream of the time when the bloom was on the cotton
When our hearts chased the clouds like the swallows on their wings
But the words to the rhyme are the only things forgotten
Sittin' on the front porch swing
Sittin' on the front porch swing"
850,Sixteen Years,Dolly Parton,"In a pickup truck we bought in 1962
And paid each month till it belonged to me and you
The cardboard boxes in the back hold everything we own
Things we've saved for sixteen years to start a brand new home
We're holding sixteen years of love in cardboard boxes
Sixteen years of laughter sweat and tears
We've stacked the back with happiness sadness love and cheer
Things we've saved together sixteen years
We sold our little dreamhouse on a small six acre farm
And said goodbye to friends we'll miss and fields of golden corn
In our search for city life where pay is big and jobs are fine
Sixteen years of love and tears following behind
We're holding sixteen years of love..."
851,Sleigh Ride,Dolly Parton,"Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling, yoo, hoo
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Giddyup, giddyup, giddyup
Let's go, let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddyup, giddyup, giddyup
It's grand just holding your hand
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy and cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop, pop, pop, pop
There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy
When you pass around the cider and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling, yoo, hoo
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you"
852,Slip Away Today,Dolly Parton,"You jark back your hand away from mine
And I move my lips away from yours
Then quietly we sit trying to forget
Those deep running thoughts that run wild across our minds
You quickly stop the words you start to say
And we realize just how close we are
And we both know if we let ourselves go
We'll do something we'll be sorry for
Slip away today means sorrow tomorrow
It's love we know but we can't keep but yet we like to borrow
Trying to hold back emotions and desires
It's hard to keep from doing something we'll be sorry for

My love hungry heart begs for more
Of what your lips hold in store
But our conscience just won't let us at least tonight it kept us
From jumping off the deep end and going too far
But one of these nights you and I
Will be ruled by the passion of our hearts
And we both know that we let ourselves go
And do something that we'll be sorry for
Slip away today means sorrow tomorrow...
It's hard to keep from doing something we'll be sorry for"
853,Slow Dancing With The Moon,Dolly Parton,"Sweet little cherry blossom, blooming before her time
Moving her lips to her favorite song, cherishing every rhyme
Swaying her hips to the rhythm, humming along with the tune
Lost in her own little dream world, slow dancing with the moon
Watching her I cannot help but go back in my mind
And suddenly I find I am 15 again
Slow dancing with the moon
Oh, the stars got in my eyes long time ago
And I've lived my life like a love sick clown
In a bittersweet cartoon
Just a dreamy-eyed kid slow dancing with the moon
Watching the girl I'm reminded she's quite a lot like me
Trapped in the suburbs of wonderland, lost in her own fantasy
Somehow my heart never grew up, no one ever burst my balloon
So here I am swirling in star dust slow dancing with the moon
Still believe someday my wildest dreams will all come true
And I'll find someone who'll make me 15 again
But until then I'm slow dancing with the moon
Oh, the stars got in my eyes long time ago
And I've lived my life like a love sick clown
In a bittersweet cartoon
Just a dreamy-eyed kid slow dancing with the moon
Tag:
Still a starry-eyed kid slow dancing with the moon"
854,Slow Healing Heart,Dolly Parton,"When I left I left walkin' wounded
I made my escape from the rain
Still a prisoner of hurt
I had months worth of work
Just freein' my mind of the pain
I had hours of sittin' alone in the dark
Listenin' to sad songs and comin' apart
Lord knows I made crying an art
Woe is a slow healing heart
Chorus:
A slow healing heart dyin' to mend
Longin' for love lonely again
But when the spirit is broken
And the memories start
Nothin' moves slower
Than a slow healing heart
How I prayed for blind faith to lead me
To places where I'm not afraid
Now I'm doin' fine both in body and mind
Some hurts take longer to fade
But there's a part of my feelings ever on guard
Against looks that are tender and words that are hard
'Cause I still remember those cutting remarks
Oh it's painful a slow healing heart
Chorus:
A slow healing heart dyin' to mend
Longin' for love lonely again
When the spirit is broken
And the memories start
You know nothin' moves slower
Than a slow healing heart
Nothin' moves slower
Than a slow healing heart"
855,Sneakin Around,Dolly Parton,"(((((From the movie The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas)))))
((((Dolly Parton & Burt Reynolds sings))))
DOLLY: I like fancy, frilly things
High-heeld shoes and diamond rings
Ragtime bands and western swing
And sneakin' around with you
BURT: Well I like beer and rodeos
Detective books and dominoes
Footballgames and Cheerios
And sneakin' around with you
DOLLY & BURT: Sneakin' around with you
Goin' a round or two
Doin' what lovers do
Whenever they're sneakin' around
DOLLY: I like lots of cash on hand
And dirty jokes about the Fuller Brush Man
BURT: I like stuff I understand, like sneakin' around with you
DOLLY: You know I like a thrill that has no strings
BURT: Friendship that don't ever change
DOLLY: And laughter from the joy of things
DOLLY & BURT: And sneakin' around with you
Sneakin' around with you
Goin' a round or two
Doin' what lovers do
Whenever they're sneakin' around
DOLLY: I like drive-in picture shows
Kissin' long and lovin' slow
BURT: The secret places lovers go, whenever they're sneakin' around
DOLLY: I like the crazy things we try
BURT: And the sexy things we fantasie
DOLLY: Just a-makin' out in the broad daylight
DOLLY & BURT: And sneakin' around with you
Sneakin' around with you
Keeping it all brand-new
Gettin' the best of you
Whenever we're sneakin' around
Sneakin' around that's all
DOLLY: I'm gonna lay down the law
BURT: Watchin' the rise and fall
DOLLy & BURT: Of lovers sneaking' around
BURT: We're just sneaking' around
DOLLY: Oh we're just
DOLLY & BURT: Sneakin'!"
856,Somebodys Everything,Dolly Parton,"I just want to be somebody's everything.
You say I've seen too many movies, watched too much TV,
read too many fairy tales that I live and make believe.
You say the kind of love I'm dreamin' of does not exist.
And there's no one like I'm searchin' for, well, I believe there is.
And I want someone to come alive when they lay eyes on me,
have a lust within their touch, a passion fire beyond belief.
Reality and fantasy should be one in the same
and I want to be somebody's everything.
I refuse to settle for something less than great.
And if it takes a lifetime, then that's how long I'll wait.
'Cause all I want is everything, is that too much to ask?
Have romance, love and passion; find magic that will last.
And I want someone to think they'll die if they can't be with me.
I want to be their joy, their pride, their dreams,
the very air they breathe.
I want to wake up feelin' loved and go to bed the same.
Yes, I want to be somebody's everything, somebody's everything.
Oh, I want someone to come alive when they lay eyes on me.
Have a lust within their touch, a passion fire beyond belief.
I'd love to wake up feelin' loved and go to bed the same.
Yes, I want to be somebody's everything.
Someone to hold me close and tremble when the lovin's done.
Think it's heaven, call me angel, think I hung the moon and sun.
Get misty eyed just knowin' with a love song people sing.
Yes, I want to be somebody's everything.
And I'm gonna be somebody's everything, somebody's everything.
I want to be, I'm gonna be somebody's everything.
I want to be, I want to be somebody's everything,
somebody's everything, somebody's"
857,Somebodys Missing You,Dolly Parton,"Somebody's missing you
Longs to be kissing you
You'd better listen
You mean all the world to me
You're on somebody's mind
Just almost all the time
Bet you already knew
Somebody's missing you
The days go slowly by
When I'm away from you
I long to see your smile
And feel the warmth of you
I've loved you for so long
But still we feel brand new
At home, inside your arms
Somebody's missing you
Somebody's missing you
Longs to be kissing you
You'd better listen
You mean all the world to me
You're on somebody's mind
Just almost all the time
I hope you miss me too
Somebody's missing you
Last thought before I sleep
First thought when I awake
You're even in my dreams
And I can hardly wait
To hear your voice again
Saying all the things you do
In case you're wondering
Somebody's missing you
Somebody's missing you
Longs to be kissing you
You'd better listen
You mean all the world to me
You're on somebody's mind
Just almost all the time
I know you know I do
Somebody's missing you
In case you're wondering
Somebody's missing you
Really, really, really, really missing you"
858,Something Fishy,Dolly Parton,"There must be something fishy going on
You said you were goin' on a fishin' trip with some old friend
You said that you'd be home tonight somewhere around ten
Well here it is, it's two o'clock and you're still not at home
I think there's something fishy goin' on
I think that I'm a sucker that's swallowing your line
I try to make myself believe that it's all in my mind
But you never asked me if I'd like to go along
So there must be something fishy goin' on
Chorus:
There's something fishy goin' on
On these fishin' trips you're goin' on
I'm gettin' tired of stayin' home alone
Some night when you come home and discover that I'm gone
You can bet there's something fishy goin' on
I guess some large-mouth bass left that lipstick on your shirt
I don't think you're a fisherman, honey
I think you're a flirt
Well if you're goin' fishin' then why don't you bring 'em home
I think there's something fishy goin' on
Repeat Chorus
Tag:
Yes, you can bet there's something fishy goin' on"
859,Something Special,Dolly Parton,"You may not know it
I don't always show it
But you're so important to me
So much that we've shared
You've always been there
I hope you always will be
Chorus:
'Cause you are something special, ooh-wee
Yes, you are something special to me
When I'm around you
The love that surrounds you
Brings comfort and warmth to my heart
A God-given treasure
You give me such pleasure
You are a true work of art
Chorus:
Yes, you are something special, yes indeed
Yes, you are something special to me
Bridge:
You're the wind 'neath my wings
Like the song that they sing
But there's so many things that you are
An angel in my life
You are the sunlight
And you hung the moon and the stars
Yes, you're special
Turnaround
Chorus:
Yes, you are something special, ooh-wee
Yes, you are something special, yes indeed
Yes, you are something special to me
MM-MM
Fade:
You are something special
MM-MM, you're something special
You are something special"
860,Somethings Burning,Dolly Parton,"You lie in gentle sleep beside me
I hear your warm and rhythmic breathing
I take your hand and hold it tightly
Listen, can you not hear our young heart's beating
Chorus:
I kiss the sleep from your eyes
Your smile is sweeter than the morning
And here it comes, can't you feel it, baby
Can't you feel it, here it comes
Feel it, feel it, fire, fire
Something's burning, something's burning
Something's burning, and I think it's love
And now the sun is burning brightly
We lie in love so close together
And I get the feeling deep inside me
My love for you will burn forever
2nd Chorus:
I cup my hands to touch your face
Once again I feel your fire
And here it comes, can't you feel it, baby
Can't you feel it, here it comes
Feel it, feel it, fire, fire
Something's burning, something's burning
Something's burning, and I think it's love
I think it's love, I think it's love
I think it's love, I think it's love
Can't you feel, the fire keeps burning
Can't you feel, the fire keeps burning
Can't you feel, the fire keeps burning love"
861,Sometimes An Old Memory Gets In My Eye,Dolly Parton,"Like someone drowning I reach for a straw
Grasping for love where there's no love at all
Slowly I'm sinking as time drags by and sometimes an old memory gets in my eye
I struggle for strenght to face the dawn
And I'm freezing to death without you to keep me warm
I hold an arm full of nothing close to my side
And sometimes an old memory gets in my eye
Sometimes an old memory gets in my eye
And when it's ours it's hard to keep my eyes dry
Don't think you see tears for I never cry
But sometimes an old memory gets in my eye
Yes sometimes an old memory gets in my eye"
862,Somewhere Along The Way,Dolly Parton,"Somewhere along the way we drifted apart
As we walked the road of love we lost our way
Now it's too late to start all over for there's no turning back
We lost each other somewhere along the way
Somewhere along the way we neglected one another
Our careless steps have led us to the end
Oh and all we can do now is just feel sorry for each other
Cause once love has died it won't ever live again
Somewhere along the way hey hey we stumbled oh and we fail
Love is not a game for fools to play
We both played and we both lost now we're both sorry and both to fault
We lost that love somewhere along the way"
863,Sounds Of Nature,Dolly Parton,"I can hear the rippling water falling gently
From the waterfall that I have found
From the meadow I hear meadowlarks a singing
Seems there's sounds of nature all around
I can hear the wind go whistling through the treetops
I hear raindrops falling softly to the ground
In the distance I can hear the roar of thunder
Seems there's sounds of nature all around
Sounds of nature fill the air with music
How I love and cherish every sound
I often kneel in prayer to thank the Master
For the sounds of nature all around
In a barren tree a lonesome dove is calling
For its mate that's nowhere to be found
In the garden I hear honeybees a humming
Sounds of nature fill the air with music...
Seems there's sounds of nature all around"
864,Sounds Of Night,Dolly Parton,"Hear the evening breezes start to blowing
See the evening shadows start to come
Listen to the nightbirds start their singing
Now the sounds of night have just begun
A lonely hootowl cries out in the darkness
For its mate that's nowhere to be found
Then a lonesome whippoorwill strats calling
Their lonely voices fill the night with sound
Hear the church bell ringing in the distance
What a mournful sound so late at night
Wonder why the darkness makes it sound so lonesome
Listen to the lonely sounds of night

The darkness seems to whisper in the silence
Your love is gone but things will be all right
Still my lonely heart cries through the darkness
Listening to the lonely sounds of night
Hear the church bell ringing in the distance..."
865,Speakin Of The Devil,Dolly Parton,"He's got a way of walkin'
He's got a way of talkin'
A way to fascinate me all the time
And he's got a way with women
A way to keep my head a swimmin'
He's got away too many times
Chorus:
Ooh, speakin' of the devil
Well, here he comes now
Lookin' like an angel
Got my defenses down
He's got me dreamin'
Got me schemin'
Ooh, speakin' of the devil
He is drivin' me wild
With that wicked little grin
And that fire in his eyes
He's got me dreamin'
Got me steamin'
Ooh, speakin' of the devil
It feels mighty close to heaven
And I'd go through hell to make him mine
He's got his spell upon me
Got to be his one and only
Burning with passion and desire
Ooh, I'm caught up in all his magic
It surely would be tragic
To never share the heat
From all this fire
Repeat Chorus Twice
Speakin' of the devil
Speakin' of the devil
I'd go through hell to make him mine"
866,Speaking Of The Devil,Dolly Parton,"He's got a way of walkin'

867,Stairway To Heaven,Dolly Parton,"There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, a stairway to heaven
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
Because you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
Oh-oh, makes me wonder. I wonder; I really, really wonder
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking
Ooh
It's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter
Oh-oh-oh-oh, Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still some time to change the road you're on
Oh, it makes me wonder
Your head is humming and it won't go in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Oh, can you hear the wind blow
And did you know your stairway lies upon the whispering wind
Stairway to heaven, stairway to heaven
You can't buy it, you can't borrow
You've got to walk it straight and narrow
Stairway to heaven, stairway to heaven, stairway to heaven
And as we walk on down the road
Our shadows longer than our souls
All that glitters is not gold
Wanna be a rock and not a roll
Oh, the great almighty dollar leaves you lonely, lost and hollow
You can't fool yourself forever
You got to work to get to heaven
Stairway to heaven
If we listen and hold fast
To every question that we asked
The truth will come to us at last
And she's buying a stairway to heaven"
868,Star Of The Show,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
We sang a love song the day that we met 
You thought that we made the perfect duet 
You liked my performance so you wanted to know 
If I would stay on as the star of the show 
And beautiful music we made for a time 'til she changed our tune 
And you added new lines 
Our duet arrangement became a trio 
Now you want a star, but I just think you should know 
I don't play second fiddle in nobody's band 
And I'm no back-up singer and I won't be a fan 
And I'm nobody's co-star 
I just play leading rolls 
And I don't want the part, don't want a part 
Won't play a part unless it's star of the show 
Oh, she's stealing the show that's been so dear to my heart 
She's changing our song 'til I'm not sure of my part 
She sharing the spotlight and there's not room for both 
Now one or the other is the star of the show, the other goes 
Life is a show and the show will go on 
The world is stage, loves an act we perform 
There's always some new act somewhere up the road 
And I'll always be staring in somebodies' show 
I don't play second fiddle in nobody's band 
And I'm no back-up singer and I won't be a fan 
And I'm nobody's co-star 
I just play leading rolls 
And I don't want the part, don't want a part 
Won't play a part unless it's star of the show 
I don't play second fiddle in nobody's band 
And I'm no back-up singer and I won't be a fan 
And I'm nobody's co-star 
I just play leading rolls 
And I don't want the part, don't want a part 
Won't play a part unless it's star of the show 
If I don't star in your show 
Well I'm still a star and I can still go 
You know I got to be, I got to be the star of the show"
869,Starting Over Again,Dolly Parton,"Momma moved out
Daddy sold the house
They split up the money
And went on their way
And all the king's horses
And all the king's men
Couldn't put mommy and daddy back together again
Chorus:
Starting over again
Where should they begin
'Cause they've never been out on their own
Starting over again
Where do you begin
When your dreams are all shattered
And the kids are all grown
And the whole world cries
Got an apartment
She moved in with her sisters
He's scheming big deals with one of his friends
While she sits at home
Just sorting out pieces
Of left over memories
From thirty odd years
2nd Chorus:
Starting over again
Where do you begin
You've never been out on your own
Starting over again
Never any end
What will the neighbors say?
They're talking talk, its small town news
Facing fifty years old
Making up a happy home
And this far down the road
You find yourself alone
Two fools
3rd Chorus:
Starting over again
Now where do you begin
When you've never been out on your own
Starting over again
Never any end
When your dreams are all shattered
And the kids are all grown
And all the king's horses
And all the king's men
Could never put mommy and daddy back together
Back together, again"
870,Stay Out Of My Bedroom,Dolly Parton,"Dolly Parton
Miscellaneous
Stay Out Of My Bedroom
1st verse:
Stay out of my bedroom
Don't be messin' up my pillows and sheets
With your powder and perfume
If you don't have some understanding of me
Don't be kncokin' on my door
I don't want you to play in my fantasies
Stay out of my bedroom
Baby, if you can't take the heat
Verse 2:
If you want it, come and get it, baby
Satisfaction guaranteed
I'm a pleaser, free and eager
I ain't never had as much fun as i need
Easy lovin', that's down my alley
I may be easy but, at least i'm cheap
Stay out of my bedroom, baby
Baby, if you can't take the heat
Chorus:
Stay out of
Stay out of
You're dealin' with some hot stuff
Baby, can you deal with the heat?
Bridge:
We might burn on forever, we might burn on tonight
Where there's smoke there is fire from the flames that i ignite
The heat is intense when the fire's blazin' high
Slavin' over all those red hot lovers at night
If you come to my bedroom the heart of the heat
I will pleasure your body in sheer ecstasy
I will touch you in places no one else ever reached
Till you won't remember anybody else but me
3rd verse:
If you want it come and get it
If it burns you don't come cryin' to me
Don't come knockin' on my door
Baby, if you can't take the heat
Don't be peepin' through my window
If you don't appreciate what you see
Stay out of my bedroom, baby
Baby, if you can't take the heat
Chorus:
Stay out of, stay out of
You're dealin' with some hot stuff
Baby, can you deal with the heat?
Stay out of my bedroom...
If you can't take it, stay out of my bedroom"
871,Steady As The Rain,Dolly Parton,"Raindrops tumble to the ground
Making puddles all around
Drops of rain that look like tears
Fall on my window pane
Raindrops seem to harmonize
With teardrops falling from my eyes
And my tears keep falling down
As steady as the rain
Steady as the rain they fall
Tears that just won't dry at all
Tears that cannot wash away the pain
Sometimes without knowing it
I touch my face and find it wet
And my tears keep falling down
As steady as the rain
I can't face the fact that
I am not important in your life
Once you lived for rollin' me
And then your feelings changed
There's just no gettin' over you
I try so hard, but it's no use
And my tears keep falling down
As steady as the rain
Raindrops just keep falling down
Beatin' out their rhythmic sounds
Dancin' as they play their sweet refrain
Memories of you cloud my mind
Cloud my eyes and I start cryin'
And my tears keep falling down
As steady as the rain
As steady as the rain
Steady as the rain they fall
Tears that just won't dry at all
Tears that just won't wash away the pain
Memories of you cloud my mind
Cloud my eyes and I start cryin'
And my tears keep falling down
As steady as the rain
As steady as the rain"
872,Still On Your Mind,Dolly Parton,"Darling you know, you know I love you like I love no other
And you told me, remember when you told me, you'd forget her in time
Time passes by but still you can't forget her, it looks like you can't forget her
Oh and that makes me wonder if you'll ever, ever be mine
There's no way, no way I'm gonna get inside of your heart, inside your heart
While there's another, another still on your mind
There's no way, no way I'm gonna get inside of your heart, inside your heart
Not when there's another, another still on your mind
There's just no way, no way I'm gonna get inside of your heart, inside your heart
Not while there's another, another still on your mind, still on your mind"
873,Straight Talk,Dolly Parton,"Gimme some straight talk, straight talk -- and hold the sugar please
Straight talk, straight talk -- sounds plenty sweet to me
Don't talk to me in circles in some mumbo-jumbo jive
Gimme just straight talk, straight talk and we're gonna be alright
'Cause I like to know just where I stand, I don't like guessing games
And I hate a bunch of gibberish, so just spit it out real plain
Don't use big educated words from your BS Degree
Straight talk, straight talk -- don't try B.S.-ing me
Straight talk, straight talk -- turn loose and let it go
You can tell me anything -- just like on Oprah's show
Just tell me how you really feel, be on the up and up
With questions I can understand -- for answers you can trust
Pick up the 'phone, you're not alone -- we've all got something to say
So listen in and listen up -- we'll find a better way
With honesty and common sense, it's really hard to miss
Straight talk, straight talk -- just tellin' it like it is
Straight talk, straight talk -- there's nothing like the truth
Just tell me all your troubles -- pretend I'm Donahue
So don't be shy, 'cause we can talk -- you know you've got a friend
Call me, call me -- for simple straight talkin'
What's cookin', America?
Straight talk, Straight talk
Straight talk, Straight talk
So some on let's talk turkey, just straight and to the point
About passions, about problems, about noses out of joint
Now I want you all to know I care and I do understand
And hey, thanks for lending me and ear out there in radioland
Give me some straight talk, straight talk -- don't sugar coat it please
Straight talk, straight talk -- sounds sweet enough to me
But don't talk to me in circles, in your mumbo-jumbo jive
Straight talk, straight talk -- and we're gonna be alright
Straight talk, straight talk -- makes plenty sense to me
Don't talk to me in circles, in your mumbo-jumbo jive
Gimme just straight talk, straight talk -- and we're gonna be alright
Gimme just straight talk, straight talk -- and we're gonna be alright"
874,Sure Thing,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
It's Saturday night and it's a perfect night for dancin' 
I've had my makeup off and on all day 
But it's gotta be right for a night of sweet romancing 
And I've combed my hair at least a thousand ways 
Mirror Mirror don't you tell a soul 
Of how I smiled and talked all day to you 
And how I practiced every step I know of 
But tonight's the night and I'm a dancing fool 
(It's a sure thing) when the sun goes down this evenin' 
(It's a sure thing) to be out on the dancing floor 
(It's a sure thing) I'll be the last one leavin' 
(It's a sure thing) gonna dance till I can't no more 
I could of had a date but I thought I'd take my chances 
I'm gonna dance with a different guy to every song 
Then I'm a gonna wait till the right one strikes my fancy 
The he's gonna be the one to dance me home 
(It's a sure thing) when the sun goes down this evenin' 
(It's a sure thing) to be out on the dancing floor 
(It's a sure thing) I'll be the last one leavin' 
(It's a sure thing) gonna dance till I can't no more 
(It's a sure thing) when the sun goes down this evenin'

875,Sweet Agony,Dolly Parton,"Well, I heard about it
That kind of need that keeps a person sleepless
All that dreaming just the same
And I read about it
I've just decide if someone leaves you breathless
But I never felt that way now I feel It
I'm not so sure I like it
But I feel it consume it be
And it's agony, sweet agony
I ain't for you, I beg for you to set me free
From this agony, sweet agony
Oh, what if I take control so easily
Sweet agony, sweet agony, sweet agony
If you had it planned out to give yourself halfway
And leave me wanting more right here on the brink
Well, your time just ran out I've got to hide it all
What are you waiting for
I'm too afraid to think what this thing is
I'm not so sure I like it that expenses just killing me
And it's agony, sweet agony
I ain't for you, I beg for you to set me free
From this agony, sweet agony
Oh, what if I take control so easily
Sweet agony, sweet agony, sweet agony
I want the real thing tired of daydreams
And don't you tease me anymore
You've got the real thing to keep me waiting
I never felt like this before
And it's agony, sweet agony
I ain't for you, I beg for you to set me free
From this agony, sweet agony
Oh, what if I take control so easily
Sweet agony, sweet agony
I ain't for you, I beg for you to set me free
From this agony, sweet agony
Oh, what if I take control so easily
Oh, it's agony, sweet agony
I ain't for you"
876,Sweet Music Man,Dolly Parton,"Sing a song sweet music man
'Cause I won't be there to hold your hand like I used to
I'm through with you
You're a heck of a singer and powerful man
But you surround yourself with people
Who demand so little of you
You touched my soul with your beautiful song
You even had me singin' along right with you
You said I need you
Then you changed the words and added harmony
Then you sang the song you had written for me to someone new
Oh, but nobody sings a love song quite like you do
Oh, and nobody else can make me sing along
Nobody else can make me feel things are right
When I know they're wrong
Nobody sings a love song quite like you
Sing your song sweet music man
Travel the world with a six piece band
That does for you what you tell 'em to
And you try to stay young but the songs are sung
To so many people who've all begun came back on you
Sing your song sad music man
Makin' your living doing one-night stands
They're through with you
They don't need you
You're still a heck of a singer but a broken man
But you'll keep on lookin' for one last fan to sing to
Oh, and nobody sings a love song quite like you do
Oh, and nobody else can make me sing along
And nobody else can make me feel things are right
When they're wrong with a song
Nobody sings a love song quite like you
Tag:
Sing your song sweet music man
I believe in you"
877,Sweet Rachel Ann,Dolly Parton,"Sweet Rachel Ann sweet Rachel Ann when are you ever coming home
Sweet Rachel Ann we've waited here through many seasons now
We've waited here but you have not returned
When you left you promised us that you'd return someday
We miss you and our love for you still burns
Our little girl who longed to see the world beyond these hills
Sweet Rachel Ann you felt you had to go
The autumn wind again has blown the last leaves from the trees
Making room for winter's ice and snow
Sweet Rachel Ann sweet Rachel Ann oh how we miss you since you've gone
Sweet Rachel Ann sweet Rachel Ann when are you ever coming home

Spring had kissed the earth again wait what's that I see
Is it someone running up the path
Oh wait a minute could it be Rachel is that you
Sweet Rachel Ann have you come home at last
Rachel I hardly recognize you now you look so tired and thin
Sweet Rachel Ann you're different than before
And that world that lies beyond these hills well it's hurt you Rachel Ann
But now you're home and nothing's gonna ever hurt you not anymore
Sweet Rachel Ann sweet Rachel Ann our love will make you good as new again
Sweet Rachel Ann sweet Rachel Ann
At last you have come home sweet Rachel Ann Rachel Ann"
878,Sweet Summer Lovin,Dolly Parton,"Though the sun may be dawning
You're the one that lights the morning
As I awake to the heaven
Of your sweet summer lovin'
By a stream in the country
Running barefoot and feeling free
While the love in our hearts blend
Into sweet summer lovin'
Sweet summer lovin' in the dandelions
Sweet summer lovin' keeps me high as candy wine
When that big red balloon sets
Like a painting across the west
As the sky turns a crimson blue
As the world turns for me and you
By the light of the moon glowing
While the warm summer wind blows
'cross the sill of your window
We'll be letting our love flow
Sweet summer lovin' in the dandelions
Sweet summer lovin' keeps me high as candy wine
Sweet summer lovin' in the dandelions
Sweet summer lovin' keeps me high as candy wine
Sweet summer lovin'
Sweet summer lovin'
Mmm...
Sweet summer lovin'
Mmm...
Sweet summer lovin'
I love your sweet summer lovin'
Sweet summer lovin'
Sweet summer lovin'
Mmm...
Sweet summer lovin'
Mmm...
Sweet summer lovin"
879,Take Me Back,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
Take me back, oh precious memories 
To the days forever gone 
I can still remember Mama washing on a rub board 
On the back porch, while us kids played in the yard 
Mama always seemed to be so happy and content 
She never seemed to mind that times were hard 
She went about her work singin' some old favorite song of hers 
And often singin' favorite songs for us 
And she was satisfied just bein' Mama to us children 
And the only woman Daddy ever loved 
Take me back to Mama's bosom 
Back to Daddy's lovin' arms 
Take me back, oh precious memories 
To the days forever gone 
I can still remember us a runnin' to meet Daddy 
In the evening when his working day was done 
When Daddy saw us comin' he would bend his tired old back 
Holdin' out his arms, and into them we'd run 
And he'd hold us for a minute, we'd all walk home together 
While Mama waited for him at the door 
And he was satisfied just bein' Daddy to us children 
And the man my Mama lived her whole life for 
Take me back to Mama's bosom 
Back to Daddy's lovin' arms 
Take me back, oh precious memories 
To the days forever gone 
Take me back, oh precious memories 
To the days forever gone"
880,Take Me Back To The Country,Dolly Parton,"Well this big city life is gettin' me down
There's just too many people around
There's dirt in the air and crime in the street
High-rise buildings and cold concrete
This rat race sure enough takes a toll
I wanna run off to my fishin' hole
Take me back take me back
Take me back to the country
Take me back take me back
Take me back to the country
Chorus:
Where the stars at night
Outshine those city lights
Take me back to the country
Where the eagles fly
And the treetops touch the sky
Take me back to the country
This traffic jam is makin' me mad
I miss the simple life I had
Peace and quite runnin' free
I wanna go home to my family
I'm sick of the clock, sick of the phone
Out in the country my time's my own
Take me back take me back
Take me back to the country
Take me back take me back
Take me back to the country
Chorus:
Where the stars at night
Outshine those city lights
Take me back to the country
Where the eagles fly
And the treetops touch the sky
Take me back to the country
Where the stars at night
Outshine those city lights
Take me back to the country
Where the eagles fly
And the treetops touch the sky
Take me back to the country
Take me back to the country"
881,Tall Man,Dolly Parton,"Oh, I wish I was a kissin' tree
A growin' in the ground
And every time my sweet pass by
I'd throw some kisses down
And if he wants more kisses
Here's all he has to do
Just come up here that kissin' tree
And I'll give him some kissin' to
I love a tall man, he ain't a small man
My man is all man and the only man for me
Now I wish, I was a kissin' tree out
On the lone prairie
And every time my sweet pass by
He'd steal a kiss from me
And if he wants more kisses
Here's all he has to know
Just plant me down in a Texas town
And watch them kisses grow
I love a tall man, he ain't a small man
My man is all man and the only man for me
And the only one for me ooh"
882,Telling Me Lies,Dolly Parton,"They say a woman's a fool for weeping
A fool to break her own heart
But I can't hold the secret I'm keeping
I'm breaking apart
Can't seem to mind my own business
Whatever I try turns out wrong
I seem like my own false witness
And I can't go on
I cover my ears, I close my eyes
Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies
Telling me lies
You told me you needed my company
And I believed in your flattering ways
You told me you needed me forever
Nearly gave you the rest of my days
Should've seen you for what you are
Should never have come back for more
Should've locked up all my silver
Brought the key right to your door
Repeat Chorus
You don't know what a chance is
Until you have to seize one
You don't know what a man is
Until you have to please one
Don't put your life in the hands of a man
With a face for every season
Don't waste your time in the arms of a man
Who's no stranger to treason
Repeat Chorus"
883,Tender Lie,Dolly Parton,"
As you walk away
As we say good-bye
What I wouldn't give
For a tender lie
Say you'll never stop loving me
Just as if it were true
How much more damage now honestly
Could one tender lie do?
When we fall so far
Are we wrong to try?
To keep out the truth
With a tender lie
Say you're going to come back to me
And I'll believe that it's true
How much more damage now honestly
Could one tender lie do?

Say you're going to come back to me
And I'll believe that it's true
How much more damage now honestly
Could one tender lie do?
How much more damage now honestly
Could one tender lie do?"
884,Tennessee Homesick Blues,Dolly Parton,"New york city ain't no kind of place
For a country girl with a friendly face
If you smile people look at you funny
They take it wrong
The greenest state in the land of the free
And the home of the grand ole opry
Is calling me back to my smoky mountain home
I wish I had my old fishin' pole
And was sitting on the banks of the fishing hole
Eating green apples and waiting for the fish to bite
Life ain't as simple as it used to be
Since the big apple took a bite out of me
And lord, I'm so tennessee homesick that I could die
Chorus:
But I ain't been home in I don't know when
If I had it all to do over again
Tonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed
What I wouldn't give for a little bitty taste
Of mama's homemade chocolate cake
Tennessee homesick blues running through my head
Mama you can fluff my feather bed
Just as soon as I can I'm gonna head
Back to the tennessee hills and it better be soon
Daddy you can load the rifles up
We're gonna load them dogs on the pickup truck
And take off to calhoun country and catch us a coon
Repeat chorus
Eatin' grits and gravy and country ham
Go to church on sunday with dinner on the grounds
Tennessee homesick blues are runnin' through my head
Repeat chorus
Good lord have mercy on a country girl
Tryin' to make a living in a rhinestone world
It's hard to be a diamond in a rhinestone world
With tennessee homesick blues runnin' through my head
I've got those tennessee homesick blues runnin' through my head
Tennessee homesick blues"
885,Thats The Way It Could Have Been,Dolly Parton,"I was so excited when you asked if I could go
But mom said I'd have to ask my daddy
I met him at the front door, so afraid that he'd say no
But he smiled and said, ""Let mama get you ready""
In your cotton shirt and faded jeans, you came for me
And the gingham dress was all I had to wear
With a dollar in your pocket and a borrowed car
You picked a yellow daisy for my hair
That's the way it could have been
Oh, that's the way it should have been
If I had met you way back then
That's the way it would have been
I put away my gingham for a pretty dress of white
And you wore a suit instead of faded jeans
Our wedding day was perfect and we loved away the night
Life for us was filled with lots of dreams
We bought a house upon a hill outside of town
And two young people finally settled in
And you just won't believe the little children running 'round
And they pick yellow daisies now and then
And that's the way it could have been
Oh, that's the way it should have been
If I had met you way back then
That's the way it would have been
That's the way it could have been"
886,Thats When Love Will Mean The Most,Dolly Parton,"When you feel the pain of loneliness inside you
And you feel the emptiness that lives within
When all the things around you had no meaning
And the lips you love can kiss you once and then
That's when love will mean the most
That's when love will hold you close
To the lips you love to touch and the things that mean so much
That's when love will mean the most

When you see a gentle smile from one that loves you
I feel a softness in the touch of love's sweet hand
Or just reminiscing back through childhood mem'ries
Of days gone by that can't return again
TThat's when love will mean the most..."
887,The Bargain Store,Dolly Parton,"My life is likened to a bargain store
And I may have just what you're looking for
If you don't mind the fact that all the merchandise is used
With a little mending it could be as good as new
Why you take for instance this old broken heart
If you will just replace the missing part
You would be surprised to find how good it really is
Take it and you never will be sorry that you did
(chorus)
The bargain store is open, come inside
You can easily afford the price
Love is all you need to purchase all the mechandise
And I can guarantee you'll be completely satisfied
Take these old used memories from the past
And these broken dreams and plans that didn't last
I'll trade them for a future, I can't use them anymore
I've wasted love, but I still have some more
(chorus)
My life is likened to a bargain store
And I may have just what you're looking for
If you don't mind the fact that all the merchandise is used
With a little mending it could be as good as new
The bargain store is open, come inside..."
888,The Blue Train,Dolly Parton,"Watching the long faces
Riding this rundown track
And the lost places
From a dream that never brings them back
And the sad truth is
Nothing but a cold hard fact
I'm riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train
Counting the burned bridges
Trailing this rusted wreck
As our back pages
Scatter in the dust we left
Like a pearl necklace
Falling from around my neck
I'm riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train
Away, down the low road
A ticket to an empty room
A rendezvous unknown
I'm riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
And I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train
I'm riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train"
889,The Camels Heart,Dolly Parton,"You come to me with teardrops in your eyes
Expecting me to listen to your lies
You want me to forget and to forgive
Enough, enough, this ain't no way to live
I know you wonder why I'd leave like this
After all the hurt I've put up with
This is the last time, this is the last straw
Too late, too late now it's your time to crawl
Chorus:
She's just the straw that broke the camel's heart
It's not her fault, it's yours we fell apart
No more, I'm done, I want a brand new start
(It's) She's just the straw that broke the camel's heart
I've been grasping at straws for much too long
This ain't the first time you have done me wrong
This time you drew the short end of the straw
The game is over, you have lost it all
Repeat Chorus
She's just the straw that broke the camel's heart"
890,The Carroll County Accident,Dolly Parton,"Carroll County's pointed out as kind of square
The biggest thing that happens is the county fair
And I guess that's why it seemed like such a big event
What we all call the Carroll County accident
The wreck was on the highway just inside the line
Walter Browning lost his life and for a time
It seemed that Mary Ellen Jones would surely die
But she lived long enough for her to testify
Now Walter Browning was a happy married man
And he wore a golden wedding ring upon his hand
But it was gone nobody knew just where it went
He'd lost it in the Carroll County accident
Mary Ellen testified he flagged her down
Said he was sick and could she drive him into town
And no one even doubted what she said was true
Cause she was well respected in the county too
Now I went down to see the wreck like all the rest
The bloody seats, the broken glass, the tangled mess
But I found something no one else had even seen
Behind the dash in Mary's crumpled up machine
A little matchbox circled by a rubberband
And inside the ring from Walter Browning's hand
And it took a while to figure out just what it meant
The truth about the Carroll County accident
By dark of night I dropped the ring into a well
And I took a sacred oath that I would never tell
The secret of the Carroll County accident
Cause the county ordered dad a marble monument
I lost him in the Carroll County accident"
891,The Christmas Song,Dolly Parton,"(Mel Torm/Robert Wells)
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some missletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with eyes all aglow
Who find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-four
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you"
892,The Company You Keep,Dolly Parton,"Yes, you're known by the company you keep
You say you're doin' nothing wrong
I don't believe you are
I'm only trying to help you sis
Before you go too far
Cause I think you're an angel
But folks think that you're cheap
Cause you're known by the company you keep
Please listen to your big sister
I feel I know what's best for you
I feel that I must warn you sis
That's the least that I could do
I'm not accusing you of anything
I know it's fun you see
But you're known by the company you keep
The company you keep keeps you out too long
Mom and dad don't go to sleep until you get home
Sis, you're gettin' in too deep
You'd better look before you leave
Cause you're known by the company you keep
Sis, you're gettin' in too deep
The road of life is steep
And you're known by the company you keep"
893,The Cruel War,Dolly Parton,"Oh
The cruel war is raging, Johnny has to fight
And I long to be with him from morning till night
I long to be with him, it grieves my heart so
Won't you let me come with you?
No, my love no
Tomorrow is Sunday, Monday is the day
Your captain will call you and you must obey
Your captain will call you, it grieves my heart so
Won't you let me come with you?
No, my love no, no, no, my love no
No, no, my love, no
But I could tie back my hair, men's clothing I'll put on
And I could march as your comrade as we go along
I could pass as your comrade, no one will ever know
Won't you let me come with you?
No, my love no
Now Johnny, oh Johnny, I feel that you are unkind
You know I love you far better than all of mankind
Yes I love you far better than words could ever express
Please won't you let me come with you?
Yes, yes, my love, yes
Oh yes, yes, yes
So we marched into battle together side by side
With hope in our hearts and love in our eyes
And we marched onto victory to wear our bands of gold
Did I ever love another?
No, my love no, no, no, my love no
No, no, my love no, no, no, my love no
Will I ever love another? No, my love no"
894,The Giving And The Taking,Dolly Parton,"I keep on a-giving
And I took all the taking
I gave all my love to you
And I took all your hurt
I treated you so good
But you treated me like dirt
They say love is give and take
Now my poor heart is breaking
I keep on a-giving
And I took all the taking
I always gave you everything
That I knew how to give
You always took advantage of me
You knew I would forgive
I treated you too good for my own good
Now I'm alone and left forsaken
I keep on a-giving
And I took all the taking
The giving and the taking
Has caused my heart to break
I've given all that I can give
And I have taken all that I can take
The giving and the taking
Has caused my heart to break
I've given all that I can give
And I have taken all that I can take"
895,The Glory Forever Live,Dolly Parton,"Thine is the kingdom
Thine is the power
And Thine is the glory forever
Our Father who art in heaven, holy be Thy name
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done
On earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
Forgive us and those who would trespass against us
Leading us not into temptation
But deliver us, deliver us from evil
For Thine is the kingdom
Thine is the power
And Thine is the glory forever
Thine is the kingdom
And Thine is the power
The glory forever a-a-amen"
896,The Grass Is Blue,Dolly Parton,"I've had to think up a way to survive
Since you said it's over
Told me good-bye
I just can't make it one day without you
Unless I pretend that the opposite's true
Rivers flow backwards
Valleys are high
Mountains are level
Truth is alive
I'm perfectly fine
And I don't miss you
The sky is green
And the grass is blue
How much can a heart and a troubled mind take
Where is that fine line before it all breaks
Can one end their sorrow
Just cross over it
And into that realm of insensitive bliss
There's snow in the tropics
There's ice on the sun
It's hot in the Arctic
And crying is fun
And I'm happy now
And I'm glad we're through
And the sky is green
And the grass is blue
And the rivers flow backwards
And my tears are dry
Swans hate the water
And eagles can't fly
But I'm alright now
Now that I'm over you
And the sky is green
And the grass is blue
And I don't love you
And the grass is blue"
897,The Great Pretender,Dolly Parton,"Oh-oh, yes I'm the great pretender
Pretending that I'm doing well
My need is such I pretend too much
I'm lonely but no one can tell
Oh-oh, yes I'm the great pretender
Adrift in a world of my own
I've played the game but to my real shame
You've left me to dream all alone
Too real is this feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal
Oh yes I'm the great pretender
Just laughin' and gay like a clown
I seem to be what I'm not, you see
I'm wearin' my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around
Too real is the feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal
Oh yes I'm the great pretender
Just laughin' and gay like a clown
I seem to be what I'm not, you see
I'm wearin' this old heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around
But I know what I am
I am the great pretender"
898,The Greatest Days Of All,Dolly Parton,"A dirt dobber built its nest
On my only Sunday dress
And the roof leaked in my shoes
And when they dried they were too small
And the rats chewed a great big hole
In my only winter coat
And at night I'd hear them gnaw
The paper on my bedroom wall
But I still say
Those were the greatest days of all
Some happy and some sad
Some good and some bad
But I still say
Those were the greatest days of all
I used to wait by the garden gate
Where the hummingbirds came ev'ry day
To kiss the yellow roses
Growing up the garden wall
And in the tall grass I would lie
'Til ev'ning shadows brought the night
Thru the window of my room
I'd hear the whippoorwill's sad call
And I still say
Those were the greatest days of all
Some happy and some sad
Some good and some bad
But I still say
Those were the greatest days of all
Now as I make my way
Along the busy city sidewalks
My head arouring from the deafening city sound
You can't hear a whipporwill in this noisy city
And tall green grass don't grow
Along the sidewalks of this town
And hummingbirds don't fly around
These artificial roses
Like they did around the garden wall
And, oh, so often in my mind
I'll go back to another time
And I still say
Those were the greatest days of all
I still say
Those were the greatest days of all"
899,The Greatest Gift Of All,Dolly Parton,"Dawn is slowly breaking
Our friends have all gone home
You and I are waiting
For Santa Clause to come
There's a present by the tree
Stockings on the wall
And knowing you're in love with me
Is the greatest gift of all
The fire is slowly fading
Chill is in the air
All the gifts are waiting
For children everywhere
Throught the window I can see
Snow begin to fall
Knowing you're in love with me
Is the greatest gift of all
Just before I go to sleep
I hear a church bell ring
Merry Christmas everyone
Is the song it sings
So I say a silent prayer
For creatures great and small
Peace on Earth, good will to men
Is the greatest gift of all
Peace on Earth, good will to men
Is the greatest gift of all"
900,The Last One To Touch Me,Dolly Parton,"If there ever was an angel, then surely you must be one
If there ever was a perfect love when I look at you I see one
If there's heaven on earth, then this must surely be
And I want you to be the last one to touch me
The last thing I remember before I go to sleep
Is the touch of your sweet lips softly kissing me
And I go to sleep athinking how happy you make me
And I want you to be the last one to touch me
And when it's time to lay me down for my eternal sleep
Once more let your fingers softly touch my cheek
If I know that you have touched me, then I can sleep in peace
And I want you to be the last one to touch me
And when the night is over and time will be no more
They say that we shall meet again upon the golden shore
And so when I awaken from my eternal sleep
I want you to be the first one to touch me
I want you to be the first, the last, the only one to touch me"
901,The Last Thing On My Mind,Dolly Parton,"It's a lesson too late for the learning
Made of sand, made of sand
In the wink of an eye my soul is turnin'
In your hand, in your hand
Are you going away
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Oh I could've loved you better
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
As we walk along my thoughts are tumblin'
Round and round, round and round
Underneath our feet are someplace rumblin'
Underground, underground
Are you going away
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Oh I could've loved you better
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
I've got reason a plenty for goin
This I know, this I know
The weeds have been steadily growin'
Please don't go, please don't go
Are you going away
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
I could've loved you better
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
Are you going away
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Oh I could've loved you better
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
You know that was the last thing on my mind"
902,The Little Things,Dolly Parton,"You never send me flowers
Or ever buy me candy
You never bring me pretty things
When you come to see me
And you forgot my birthday
Oh I wish you could see
How I miss
The little things
That you don't do for me
You never say that I look nice
Or that you're proud of me
You overlook
The little things
That you should see
These little things are big enough to hurt
But too small to make me want to leave
But I do miss
The little things
That you don't do for me
Now how can I miss flowers
That never reach my door
How can I taste candy
That's still at the candy store
These little things mean a lot to me
To you they may be silly
But I do miss
The little things
That you don't do for me
Yes I miss
The little things
That you don't do for me"
903,The Lonesomes,Dolly Parton,"My heart's as heavy as an anvil. 
My tears are puddled in my eyes 
and time seems to be at a standstill. 
I've really got the lonesomes tonight. 
Feels like I'm never gonna make it. 
I'd like to lie right down and die. 
It's so very hard to fake it. 
I've really got the lonesomes tonight. 
Just like that old song by Hank Williams; 
I am so lonesome I could cry. 
Can't seem to shake these sad old feelin's, 
I've really got the lonesomes tonight. 
'Cause I've really got the lonesomes tonight. 
Oooh, I'm pretty sad. 
Oh, I hope tomorrow will ring truer, 
and I'll awake and I will be all right. 
But right now I couldn't feel much bluer, 
can't shake these lonely memories inside. 
Oh, but my heart's as heavy as an anvil. 
My tears are all puddled in my eyes. 
And my mind has really got its hands full, 
I've really got the lonesomes tonight. 
You got that right, 
I've really got the lonesomes tonight. 
But I'll be all right, 
I've really got the lonesomes tonight. 
Got the lonesomes."
904,The Lord Is My Shepherd Live,Dolly Parton,"The Lord is my Shepherd, the Lord is my Shepherd
My friend and helper, I shall not want
He's there to guide me, standing beside me
The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want

The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures
He leadeth me beside the still waters
He restoreth my soul;
(I shall not want...)
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name' sake
And yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil: For thou art with me
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me
(I shall not want...)
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies
Thou annointh my head with oil; My cup runneth over
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life
And I shall dwell in the House of the Lord forever"

907,The Man,Dolly Parton,"I don't know why I like him, I just only know I do
I don't know why I trust him, I just know his heart is true
I don't know why he's more a man than any man I know
I don't know how I know the man's for real but I still know
The man is more than what meets the eye
He is worn and weary from life
He is rugged but he's got style
The man has got what matters inside
Weary, yes he must get weary but he doesn't say
But you can read between the lines that wind along his face
The man has got his memories that he hides inside his mind
And you can see the sadness in the eyes they hide behind
The man is more than what meets the eye
He is worn and weary from life
He is rugged but he's got style
The man has got what matters inside
Love him, yes I've always loved him and I always will
He holds a place in my heart no one else could ever fill
He's always been my hero, the best friend I've ever had
The man is something special and I'm proud that he's my dad
The man is more than what meets the eye
He is worn and weary from life
He is rugged but he's got style
The man has got what matters inside"
908,The Masters Hand,Dolly Parton,"Writer Myra Brooks Welch
""Twas battered and scared, and the auctioneer
Thought it scarcely worth his while
To waste much time on the old violin,
But he held it up with a smile.
""What am I bidden, good folks,"" he cried,
""Who'll start bidding for me?
A dollar, a dollar - now who""ll make it two
Two dollars, and who""ll make it three?
""Three dollars once, three dollars twice,
Going for three"". . . but no!
From the room far back a gray-haired man
Came forward and picked up the bow;
Then wiping the dust from the old violin,
And tightening up the strings,
He played a melody, pure and sweet,
As sweet as an angel sings.
The music ceased and the auctioneer
With a voice that was quiet and low,
Said: ""What am I bidden for the old violin?""
And he held it up with the bow;
""A thousand dollars - and who'll make it two?
Two thousand - and who'll make it three?
Three thousand once, three thousand twice
And going - and gone,"" said he.
The people cheered, but some of them cried,
""We do not quite understand -
What changed its worth?"" The man replied:
""The touch of the masters hand.""
And many a man with life out of tune,
And battered and torn with sin,
Is auctioned cheap to a thoughtless crowd.
Much like the old violin.
A ""mess of pottage,"" a glass of wine,
A game and he travels on,
He's going once, and going twice -
He's going - and almost gone!
But the MASTER comes, and the foolish crowd,
Never can quite understand,
The worth of a soul, and the change that's wrought
By the touch of the MASTER'S hand."
909,The Moon The Stars And Me,Dolly Parton,"Tonight I feel a chill in the air
As cold as that look on your face
I hear what you're saying but coming from you
Goodbye seems so out of place
Now how can you stand there and honestly say
There never wee any real promises made
Chorus:
The moon is my witness
The stars will agree
They all heard you promise
You'd always love me
I know that it's true
But it's hard to believe
You lied to the moon
The stars and me
And what about all of those warm tender nights
Did they mean nothing to you
And where are the feelings I thought that we shared
Or have you forgotten them too
Did you think I could just put your memory behind
When your words are still so very clear in my mind
Chorus:
The moon is my witness
The stars will agree
They all heard you promise
You'd always love me
I know that it's true
But it's hard to believe
You lied to the moon
The stars and me
The moon is my witness
The stars will agree
They all heard you promise
You'd always love me
I know that it's true
But it's hard to believe
You lied to the moon
The stars and me
I know that it's true
But it's hard to believe
You lied to the moon
The stars and me
You lied"
910,The Only Hand Youll Need To Hold,Dolly Parton,"When you need to be love, let me love you
When you need a friend, reach out to me
When you need reassuring that it's alright
Anything you need, that what I'll be
For I want to be the one you always come to
When you find you need a place to go
Let mine be the hand you always cling to
Mine will be the only hand you ever need to hold
Mine will be the only hand you ever need to hold
I can be the one that makes you happy
I'll be your umbrella when it rains
I will be someone that you can count on
In other words, I'll be your everything
For I want to be the one you always come to
When you find you need a place to go
Let mine be the hand you always cling to
Mine will be the only hand you ever need to hold
Mine will be the only hand you ever need to hold
I want to be the one you always come to
When you find you need a place to go
Let mine be the hand you always cling to
Mine will be the only hand you ever need to hold
Mine will be the only hand you ever need to hold"
911,The Only Way Out Is To Walk Over Me,Dolly Parton,"The only way out
Is to walk over me
So you found someone else
And you're going to leave
Did she tell you
I don't love you?
Did you really believe?
On the floor, by the door
I'll be down on me knees
Chorus:
Cause the only way out
Is to walk over me
You don't hear and you don't feel
But i know you can see
And just to prove that i love you,
I'll crawl at your feet
Just look down, at the ground
Where your footprints will be
Repeat Chorus
Bridge:
You have put me
Just as low
As anyone ought to go
But i'll lay down beside
What's left of my pride
If you go, then you'll
Know, cause you can't help
But see that
The only way out is to walk
Over me
Repeat Bridge
Yes the only way out
Is to walk over me"
912,The Pain Of Loving You,Dolly Parton,"You just can't stand to see me happy
Seems you hurt me all you can
Still I go on loving you
But I never understand
Oh, the pain of loving you
Oh, the misery I go through
Never knowing what to do
Oh, the pain of loving you
To love and hate at the same time
The line between the two is fine
The two have bound me heart and soul
So strong that I can't let you go
Oh, the pain of loving you
Oh, the misery I go through
Never knowing what to do
Oh, the pain of loving you
Oh, the pain of loving you"
913,The Right Combination,Dolly Parton,"Two people, together
It was just a dream until you came along
My heart was waiting just for you
Tomorrow, forever
We both heard these promises for far too long
And now you make the words come true
So touch me now
I need to have you close tonight
And show me how
You can me feel this way
# you and me, we are the right combination
For love, we're all we need
It's just you and me, we make the right combination
Straight from the heart, love is the key
Can't keep it, a secret
Everything I feel is written on my face
I can't hide my heart from you
You hold me, is magic
In your arms the world becomes a better place
Now I know what love can do
Here we go
Exactly where the road will lead us
I don't know
I just know that you'll be there
# you and me, we are the right combination
For love, we're all we need
It's just you and me, we make the right combination
Straight from the heart, love is the key
And whenever you, I'm there
Every stumble and fall, I share
I'll be yours through it all
Coz I care, about you baby
It's so easy to see, so strong
Now I know you and me, belong
I'll be by your side forever...
# you and me, we are the right combination
For love, we're all we need
It's just you and me, we make the right combination
Straight from the heart, love is the key"
914,The River Unbroken,Dolly Parton,"Waiting for the train to come
I keep a'waiting for the train to come
Dreamin' of the river and the rising sun
I keep thinkin' 'bout the world to come
My life packed up in a suitcase
Old man staring from a doorway
My hope tarries in the distance
Love comes on the wheels of my deliverance
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Waitin' for the train to come
I keep waitin' for the train to come
Keepin' my appointment with the one who lives
In the heart of everything that is
All night sleepin' in a station
My God, it's hard not to be impatient
I watch through the windows of forgiveness
I cry but my word's my only witness
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Sometimes I feel I can't go on, I can't go on
I get so tired, all passion's gone
My heart, my head, my arms, my legs, I get so tired
Without the strength to crawl away
Then something breaks inside my soul, My strength is gone
That spirit's finally taking hold
My ears can hear, my eyes can see
Those clouds of joy still cover me, cover me, cover me
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is, where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Fade:
Waiting for the train to come
I keep waiting for the train to come..."
915,The Sacrifice,Dolly Parton,"Well, I've sacrificed time with family and friends
Gave up vacations for work without end
24/7, 365
But I was willing to make the sacrifice
But empty or full, I've carried my pale
You don't drink the water if you don't dig the well
Through blood sweat and tears I have built a good life
But it didn't come without sacrifice
But I was gonna be rich no matter how much it cost
And I was gonna win no matter how much I lost
All through the years I kept my eye on the prize
You ask if it's worth the sacrifice, the sacrifice
I think about Jesus and all that he gave
And the ultimate sacrifice that he made
He is my strength and my guiding light
And he's taught me that nothing's without sacrifice
I was gonna be rich no matter how much it cost
And I was gonna win no matter how much I lost
I wanted success and, brother, I've paid the price
And, yes, it's been worth the sacrifice, the sacrifice
I was gonna be rich no matter how much it cost
And I was gonna win no matter how much I lost
Grindstones and rhinestones have made up my life
But I've shined like a diamond through sacrifice
I was gonna be rich no matter how much it cost
And I was gonna win no matter how much I lost
But I hope God will tell me, 'Well done, my child
You've won your reward through your sacrifice, the sacrifice'
The sacrifice
But sometimes I wonder in the still of the night
Is it really worth the sacrifice
I've often laughed and I've often cried
I've often failed but I've always tried
I made the sacrifice"
916,The Salt In My Tears,Dolly Parton,"I've tried and I've tried for so long to please you
Gave you every bit of my time
Gave you everything I could possibly give you
My body, my heart, and my mind
I turned my family and good friends against me
Listened to my own heart break
And I did it all in the name of love
Gave up myself for your sake
And you never cared about me
You only hurt and deceive
I realize after all of these years
That you ain't worth the salt in my tears
You've cheated, you've lied and you've hurt me
Over and over again
You promised to love me forever
But forever reached a bitter sweet end
Been blinded by love to your actions
But at last I can see my way clear
I've cried and I've tried, and I've tried and I've cried
But you, you've never shed one tear
'Cause you never cared about me
You only hurt and deceive
I realize after all of these years
That you ain't worth the salt in my tears
You ain't worth, you ain't worth the salt in my tears
Treated like dirt, I'm hurt, I ain't hangin' 'round here
You've left me crying, left me crying for years
But you ain't worth the salt in my tears
You never cared about me
You only hurt and decieve
I realize after all of these years
That you ain't worth the salt in my tears
No you ain't worth the salt in my tears"
917,The Seeker,Dolly Parton,"I am a seeker
A poor sinful creature
There is no weaker than I am
I am a seeker
You are a teacher
You are a reacher
So reach down
Won't you reach out and lead me
Guide me and keep me
In the shelter of your care each day
'Cause I am a seeker
You are a keeper
You are the leader
Won't you show me the way
I am a vessel that's empty and useless
I am a bad seed that fell by the way
I am a loser that wants to be a winner
And you are my last hope
Don't turn me away
Chorus:
I am a seeker
A poor sinful creature
There is no weaker than I am
I am a seeker
You are a teacher
You are a reacher
So reach down
Won't you reach out and lead me
Guide me and keep me, Lord
In the shelter of your care each day
'Cause I am a seeker
You are a keeper
You are the leader
Won't you show me the way
Oh, I know you are a mountain
From which there flows a fountain
So let it's water wash my sins away
'Cause I am a seeker
You are a keeper
You are the leader
Won't you show me the way"
918,The Star Spangled Banner,Dolly Parton,"Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?"
919,The Tracks Of My Tears,Dolly Parton,"Now people say I'm the life of the party
'Cause I'll tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep down inside I'm blue
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you, I need you
But since you left, if you see me with another guy
Seeming like I'm having fun
He might look good, it's true but he's a substitute
'Cause you were the perfect one
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you, I need you
Outside, I'm masquerading
'Cause inside my hope is fading
Like a clown since you put me down
And my smile is my makeup
I wear since my breakup with you
Stop, take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
Just take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
Just take a, take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
Just take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place"
920,The Twelfth Of Never,Dolly Parton,"You ask me how much I need you
Must I explain
I need you oh my darlin'
Like roses need the rain
You ask how long I'll love you
I'll tell you true
Until the twelfth of never
I'll still be loving you
So hold me close
Never let me go
Hold me close
Melt my heart like April snow
I'll love you 'til the bluebells
Forget to bloom
I'll love you 'til the clover
Has lost its perfume
I'll love you 'til the poets
Run out of rhyme
Until the twelfth of never
And that's a long, long time
So hold me close
Never let me go
Just hold me close
Melt my heart like April snow
You ask how much I need you
Must I explain
I need you oh my darlin'
Like the roses need the rain
You ask how long I'll love you
I'll tell you true
Until the twelfth of never
I'll still be lovin' you
So hold me close
And never let me go
Just hold me close
Melt my heart like April snow
I'll love you 'til the poets
Run out of rhyme
Until the twelfth of never"
921,The Way I See You,Dolly Parton,"You're gentle body lying here so close to me
As you move your hand slowly across my face
You're touch is as soft as the words you speak to me
What a love in the way I see you
I compare it with the beauty of the dawning
Or when the sun sets and paints its picture in the blue
Like a butterfly that has a million colors, all such beauty
Like the love in the way I see you
I compare it with the beauty of the dawning
Or when the sun sets and paints its picture in the blue
Like a butterfly that has a million colors, all such beauty
What a love in the way I see you"
922,There,Dolly Parton,"There is a place where the sun's always glowing
Take me there, won't you take me there
Meadows grow green near the streams gently flowing
Take me there, won't you take me there
A city of riches beyond comprehension
Take me there, won't you take me there
Streets are of gold, gates of pearl, brilliant mansions
Take me there, won't you take me there
Chorus:
Take me and show me this rare place you speak of
Take me there, won't you take me there
To this land of plenty where there is complete love
Take me there, won't you take me there
At the foot of the throne the kingdom rejoices
Take me there, won't you take me there
The angels are singing His praise with their voices
Hallelujah, hallelujah take me there
Peace, joy and love linger on through the ages
Take me there, won't you take me there
Lambs lay with lions and lions with babies
Take me there, won't you take me there
Take me and show me this rare place you speak of
Take me there, won't you take me there
To this land of plenty where there is complete love
Take me there, I can't take you there
But there is a church where they teach all about it
Take me there, won't you take me there
There is a book we must not be without it
Take me there, I will read with you there
There is an altar where sins are forgiven
Take me there, yes I'll kneel with you there
We'll find there the God of Eternal Living
Take me there, He will take you there
There is no sorrow and no heartache there
There is no crying and no dying there
Won't you take me there, won't you take me there
Hallelujah won't you take me there"
923,There Will Be Peace In The Valley For Me,Dolly Parton,"Peace in the valley for me some day
Well, I'm tired and so weary, but I must travel on
'Til the Lord comes and calls me away, oh yes
Where the morning's so bright and the Lamb is the light
And the night is as bright as the day, oh yes!
There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord, I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble I see
Only peace in the valley for me, oh yes!
Well the bear will be gentle and the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes!
And the beasts from the wild shall be led by a little child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh yes!
There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord, I pray
And there'll be no sadness and no sorrow, no trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh yes!
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh yes!"
924,Therell Always Be Music,Dolly Parton,"A mother sings as she rocks her babies
Children sing the noted nursery rhymes
The old church bell is ringing for the Sunday morning singing
Music is as old as the time
As the farmer works the fields he sings a song
The songbirds in the trees sing along
And the wind makes melodies as it whistles through the trees
Man's burdens are made lighter with a song
There'll always be music as long as there's a story to be told
There'll always be music cause music is the voice of the soul
There'll always be music
Rain makes rhytmic sounds when it's falling
There's music in a new born baby's cry
There's music all around and there is no sweeter sound
For that's the way a man expresses life
In heaven there's a choir of angels singing
We often heard about God's angel band
Music will live on when men on earth are gone
There'll still be music in that promised land
There'll always be music..."
925,Therell Be Love,Dolly Parton,"There'll be love love love oh precious love
Just as long as there's two people there'll be love
In spite of hate that fills the land love will always have command
As long as there's two people there'll be love
God created man and woman at the start
And he placed inside of them a lovin' heart
But it wasn't God that made the hate and lust
But as long as there's two people there'll be love
There'll be love love love...

For every person somewhere there's a mate
It's the force for survival that brings hate
For even though the going might be rough
As long as there's two people there'll be love
You can lock a man behind a prison wall
And you may think that he has no love at all
But there's someone somewhere that he's thinking of
For as long as there's two people there'll be love
There'll be love love love..."
926,Theres Something Fishy Goin On,Dolly Parton,"There must be something fishy goin' on
You said you were goin' on a fishing trip with some old friend
You said that you'd be home tonight somewhere around ten
Well here it is it's two o'clock and you're still not at home
I think there's something fishy goin' on
I think that I'm a sucker that's swallowing your line
I try to make myself believe that it's all in my mind
But you never ask me if I'd like to go along so there must be something fishy goin' on
There's something fishy goin' on on these fishing trips you're goin' on
I'm gettin' tired of staying home alone
Some night when you come home and discover that I'm gone
You can bet there's something fishy goin' on
I guess some large-mouth bass left that lipstick on your shirt
I don't think you're a fisherman honey I think you're a flirt
Well if you're goin' fishing then why don't you bring them home
I think there's something fishy goin' on
here's something fishy goin' on...
Yes you can bet there's something fishy goin' on"
927,These Old Bones,Dolly Parton,"
""These old bones will tell your story
These old bones will never lie
These old bones will tell you surely
What you can't see with your eye
These old bones, I shake and rattle
These old bones, I toss and roll
And it's all in where they scatter
Tells you what the future holds""

Oh, she lived up on the mountain
Eleven miles or so from town
With a one-eyed cat named Wink
A billy goat and a blue tick hound
Her graying hair was braided
And wrapped around her head
And her dress was long and faded
And her home a rusty shed
In a little pouch of burlap
Tied with a piece of twine
There were bones all shapes and sizes
Gathered through the course of time
She'd throw them out before you
She swore that she could see
The present, past, and future
She could read your destiny
Everybody knew about her
Came to get their fortune read
Concerning health and wealth and power
Who to love and when to wed
""Well, I just like helping people
I'm just glad that I could help
Why, I know everybody's secrets
But I keep it to myself""


Some called her a witchy woman
Some said she was insane
Some said she was a prophet
Still everybody came
""Just because a body's different
Well, that don't make them mad
Well, they've crucified a many
For the special gifts they've had""
I had often heard about her
Dreamed about her now and then
For I, too, was clairvoyant
Came about when I was ten
I was fascinated with her
And the things I'd heard about
And I knew some day I'd meet her
And one day it came about
""Well, I knowed that you's a-comin'
I could feel it in my bones
These old bones have also told me
That I won't be here for long
Did you know that you got adopted?
Did you know you once't was mine?
But the county took you from me
Said I wasn't right in mind""
""But I just knowed I had to see you
'Fore these bones was laid to rest
So I conjured up a message
It musta worked, I guess
This gift runs in the family
I know you also know
And I passed this gift on to you
These old bones, they're just for show""


I held her hand while she was dying
And with the funeral through
I headed on back up the mountain
For Billy, Wink and Blue
And that little pouch of burlap
With those bones so worn and old
She give me something special
Now every time I throw


""Now I can't tell you what you want to hear
I just tell you what I see
It's these old bones talking
Blame it on them; don't pack it on me
It's just like that time that there boy died
Up at the sawmill
Well, I know'd who done it, but I never said
And I know'd when somebody is a cheating
Or when somebody's baby was going to be born dead
But unless somebody just plain out and asked me
Well, I just figured there is no point going around acting like you know everything, just because you might
Ah, you know girl I want you to take these bones
Because I don't want no young of mine going around unprepared
You just remember that the magic is inside you
There is no crystal ball"""
928,Think About Love,Dolly Parton,"I can't forget you
Ever since the moment that I met you
You've been on my mind
And I need to somehow let you know
That I think about you all the time
So when you think about love, think about me
I can give you more than you'll ever need
Sooner or later every heart needs some company
When you think about love, think about me
When you think about love, think about me
We were strangers
Now I'm already wrapped around your finger
Oh whats a heart to do
'Cause it lingers
And the thought of you
Wantin' me as much as I want you
So when you think about love, think about me
I can give you more than you'll ever need
Sooner or later every heart needs some company
When you think about love, think about me
When you think about love, think about me
Makes me blue
I'm not holding you tonight
Cause only you can satisfy
This heart of mine
So when you think about love, think about me
I can give you more than you'll ever need
Sooner or later every heart needs some company
When you think about love, think about me
When you think about love, think about me
So when you think about love, think about me
I can give you more than you'll ever need
Sooner or later every heart needs some company
When you think about love, think about me
When you think about love, think about me"
929,This Boy Has Been Hurt,Dolly Parton,"I saw him picking up the pieces of his broken heart
And so I stopped to see what I could do
His heart had been run over by a reckless lover
She ran over it and broke it and left it black and blue
Tears were scattered everywhere he was trying to save his pride
He was the victim of a love and run
And I could plainly see that she had almost killed him
Left the scene of a broken heart not looking back at what she'd done
Oh, this boy has been hurt, I'll save him
I'll take his heart and mend it if I can
Oh, this boy has been hurt, I'll save him
I'll take his tears and dry them as fast as he can cry them
I'll heal his hurt and make him as good as new again"
930,Those Memories Of You,Dolly Parton,"Those memories of you still haunt me
Every night when I lay down
I'll always love you my little darling
Until the day they lay me down
In dreams of you my body trembles
I wake up and call your name
But you're not there, and I'm so lonesome
Without your love I'd go insane
Those memories of you still haunt me
Every night when I lay down
I'll always love you my little darling
Until the day they lay me down
I close my eyes and you're there with me
Your kiss I feel, your face I see
It's not your lips now that drive me crazy
It's just your haunting memory
Those memories of you still haunt me
Every night when I lay down
I'll always love you my little darling
Until the day they lay me down
Until the day they lay me down"
931,Thought I Couldnt Dance,Dolly Parton,"Stand back, and give me room
And listen to that beat
I got the music in my soul
And the rhythm in my feet
When I hear the music,
You won't catch me standing still
And I won't miss a beat
I never have and I never will
And you thought I couldn't dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
I can dance to anything
That any band can play
I've got old-fashioned values
But I'm pretty up to date
And I know all the latest hits
On the radio
You don't have to join me
Stand back and watch my show
And you thought I couldn't dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
Thought I couldn't dance
Hey, watch me prance
Let's make romance
Thought I couldn't dance
You gotta take a chance
If you're gonna learn to dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
There's a lot of closet dancers
Just dyin' to come out
They dance alone inside their rooms
With the music way up loud
And I know you thought I couldn't dance
But I guess I sure fooled you
It just goes to show you never know
Who's wearing dancin' shoes
And you thought I couldn't dance
I'm full of surprises
And you thought I couldn't dance
It's too late now
I can't slow down... can't slow down
Oh, feel the heat
From these dancin' feet... can't slow down
And you thought I couldn't dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
Repeat..."
932,Thoughtfulness,Dolly Parton,"Thoughtfulness tenderness makes love grow stronger
Thoughtfulness brings happiness makes love last much longer
Love is like a tender young flower
It needs care from the time you sow
Tender words of love are like summer showers
Makes love strong when cold winds blow
Thoughtfulness tenderness...
Pull out the weeds of doubt and jealousy give love a chance to grow
Kisses are like sunshine you'll soon see love can bloom even in the snow
Thoughtfulness tenderness makes love grow stronger
Thoughtfulness brings happiness thoughtfulness thoughtfulness"

'Cause these days love gets strained a lot
To give our hearts a double shot
Let's tie our love in a double knot
Woah, if we want to endure
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure

To give our hearts a double shot

936,Till Death Do Us Part,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
Today you told me that you'd found another
And you took off your golden wedding band
The one you vowed you'd wear until death do us part
When I kissed it and placed it on your hand.
A wreath will hang upon the door tomorrow
Of the little house that we once called our home
And friends will stop and hang their heads in sorrow
To pay the last respects to one gone on.
Tonight I lay me down to sleep forever
With this small empty bottle and broken heart
I keep the vow I made I won't forsake it
I promised to death do us part.
Will you bring your new love to the chapel
To look upon the one that you betrayed
Will you bring me pretty flowers like you used to
And replace them in my hands where I lay.
Will you cry and think of happy mem'ries
That we shared together at the start
And will you look upon me and remember
The day we said till death do us part..."
937,Time And Tears,Dolly Parton,"I didn't cry all of these tears just to have you show up here again
I didn't lie awake all these nights to have you come walking back in
I didn't change my whole life around, not to mention my dreams and my plans
To have you come back with your same ol' act thinking that I'll understand
Time and tears have mended the pain
Healed all the hurt and changed everything
Time and tears I'm happy to say
Time and tears have washed it away
Time and tears have washed you away
I didn't think that I would survive the day that you walked out on me
I truly was more dead than alive; and the pain, Lord I couldn't believe
I asked God to please have mercy on me and to ease all the feelings I felt
Then I saw the light, now I'm more than alright;
I'm much better off since you left
Time and tears have mended the pain
Healed all the hurt and changed everything
Time and tears have carried me through
Time and tears got me over you
Time and tears and somebody new
Time and tears is all that it takes
To mend shattered hopes or a heart when it breaks
Time and tears have carried me through
Time and tears got me over you
Time and tears and somebody new
Time and tears, time and tears got me over you
Time and tears, got me over you"
938,Time For Me To Fly,Dolly Parton,"I've been around for you
Been up and down for you
But I just can't get any relief
I've swallowed my pride for you
I've lived and lied for you
But you still make me feel like a thief
You've got me stealing your love away
'Cause you never give it
Peelin' the years away
And we can't relive it
I make you laugh and you make me cry
I believe it's time for me to fly
Chorus:
Time for me to fly
I've got to set myself free
Time for me to fly
That's how it's got to be
I know it hurts to say goodbye
But it's time for me to fly
You said we'd work it out
You said that you had no doubt
I thought we were really in love
Oh but I'm tired of holding on
To a feeling I know is gone
I do believe I've had enough
I've had enough of the falseness
Of a worn out relation
Enough of this jealousy and intoleration
I wonder why I even try
I believe it's time for me to fly
Chorus:
Time for me to fly
I've got to set myself free
Time for me to fly
That's just how it's got to be
I know it hurts to say goodbye
But it's time for me to fly
Time for me to fly
Time for me to fly
I got to set myself free
Time for me to fly
That's just how it's got to be
I make you laugh and you make me cry
I believe it's time for me to fly
Time for me to fly
That's how it's got to be
I know it hurts to say goodbye
But it's time for me to fly"
939,To Daddy,Dolly Parton,"""To Daddy""
Momma never seemed to miss the
finer things in life
If she did, she never did say so to
daddy
She never wanted to be more than
mother and a wife
If she did, she never did say so to
daddy
The only things that seemed to be
important in her life
Was to make our house a home
and make us happy
Momma never wanted anymore
than what she had
If she did, she never did say so to
daddy
He often left her all alone
She didn't mind the stayin' home
If she did, she never did say so to
daddy
And she never missed the flowers
And the gifts he never gave her
If she did, she never did say so to
daddy
Being took for granted was a thing
that she accepted
And she didn't need those things to
make her happy
She didn't even seem to notice
That he didn't kiss and hold her
If she did, she never did say so to
daddy
One morning we awoke
Just to find the note
That momma carefully wrote
And left to daddy
And as he began to read it
Our ears could not believe it
The words that she had written
there to daddy
She said our kids are old enough
And they don't need me very much
So I've gone in search for love I
need so badly
I have needed you so long
But I just can't keep holdin' on
She never meant to come back
home
If she did, she never did say so to
daddy
Momma's gone
Good-bye to daddy"
940,To Know Him Is To Love Him,Dolly Parton,"Chorus:
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do
I'll be good to him
I'll bring love to him
Everyone says there'll come a day
When I'll walk alongside of him
Yes just to know him
Is to love love love him
And I do
Why can't he see
How blind can he be
Someday he will see
That he was meant for me
Repeat Chorus"
941,Today I Started Loving You Again,Dolly Parton,"(Merle Haggard/Bonnie Owens) 
Today I started loving you again 
I'm right back where I've really always been 
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend 
And then today I started loving you again 
What a fool I was to think I could get by 
With only these few million tears I've cried 
I guess I should have known the worst was yet to come 
And the crying time for me had just begun 
Today I started loving you again 
I'm right back where I've really always been 
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend 
And then today I started loving you again 
Today I started loving you again 
I'm right back where I've really always been 
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend 
And then today I started loving you again 
Today I started loving you again 
Today I started loving you 
Today I started loving you again"
942,Together Always,Dolly Parton,"You and I have been together for a long long time
And we vowed that we would stay together always
Life at times has been unpleasant down the trails where fate had led us
But we pray that God will let us be together always
Together together together always you and me
Forever and ever together always you and me

Throught the years our love will multiply and be divided
By the children added to enrich our lives
God's been good to you and I and in heaven there's eternal life
Beyond this world where you and I will be together always
Together together...
Together together..."
943,Together Forever,Dolly Parton,"Together, together

Together (Together)
Together, together

Adventures can be fun
As long as there's someone
Besides you that can share in your ""whatever""s (whatever)
And even when you stray
You'll always find a way
And that's why you and I must stay together
Together, together
You and I should always stay together
Forever, forever

944,Together You And I,Dolly Parton,"My love for you is deeper than the depth of any ocean
And as faithful as the stars that grace the night
As constant as the sun making its journey through the heavens
And we will always be together you and I
Together you and I can stop the rain and make the sun shine
Paint a pretty rainbow brushed with love across the sky
Together you and I belong like a songbird and a song
And we will always be together you and I
Life with you is sweeter than the fragrance of the flowers
And as happy as the laughter of a child
As peaceful as a river endless lasting as forever
You know we'll always be together you and I.
Together you and I can stop the rain and make the sun shine
Paint a pretty rainbow brushed with love across the sky
Together you and I belong like a songbird and a song
And we will always be together you and I
I'll always be beside or close behind you
Wherever you go, you'll always know I'll always find you
Together you and I can stop the rain and make the sun shine
Paint a pretty rainbow brushed with love across the sky
Together you and I belong like a songbird and a song
And we'll always be together you and I
We'll always be together you and I
Forever together, together forever you and I
Forever together, together you and I will always be
Together you and I"
945,Tomorrow Is Forever,Dolly Parton,"Take my hand and run with me
Out of the past of yesterday
And walk with me into the future of tomorrow
Yesterday must be forgot
No looking back no matter what
There's nothing there but mem'ries that bring sorrow
Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever
No more crying tears leave tracks
And mem'ries find their way back
Tomorrow's waiting let's journey there together
Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever
I care not for yesterday I love you as you are today
Yesterday just helped to pass the time while waiting
We must forget the passing time
My love for you is the real kind
The kind that won't hurt you, oh never
Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever
Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever"
946,Too Far Gone,Dolly Parton,"We never have a kind word for each other angry words are all we speak
The home where we once lived and loved now echoes with the angry words we speak
Too selfish and too proud to admit it when we know that we are wrong
Now it's too late to rebuild the home we're tearing down it's too far gone
Two people just existing always talking never listening
Too busy pointin' out each other's fault to see our own
Because we didn't try our love just slowly died
Too late to be revived it's too far gone
(Too far gone too far gone too far gone)
We're too busy thinking of ourselves to think about each other's needs
We seldom have a moment for each other we share little that we need
We can't get along even long enough to try to change what's wrong
Now it's too late for you and me zhere's nothing we can do we're too far gone
Two people just existing..."
947,Too Lonely Too Long,Dolly Parton,"No matter how you're tempted
Don't say yes to me
Don't make this night as smooth to lead me on
It's just that I'm so lonely and I need someone
I've been too lonely too long
Oh please be strong enough to refuse me
Before I let myself do something wrong
For down inside I'm not that kind of woman
I've been too lonely too long
Oh please don't take advantage of the situation
For I'm afraid that I'm too weak to resist temptation
When you're used to being loved
It's hard to live alone
I've been too lonely too long
I've been too lonely too long"
948,Touch Your Woman,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
We can't always both be right 
We sometimes disagree 
But you've got the right to speak your mind 
An' it's the same with me 
When the anger's at an end 
And you want inside my arms again 
All you have to do to make it right is just 
Touch your woman 
Touch your woman 
Everything's gonna be alright 
Touch your woman 
Touch your woman 
Let me know, let me know everything's alright 
There are times when I should be strong 
When I'm awfully weak 
When the sudden blows of life have brought me to my knees 
Woman needs a helpin' hand 
Needs someone to understand 
Needs the man she loves to help her stand, so 
Touch your woman 
Touch your woman 
Everything's gonna be alright 
Touch your woman 
Touch your woman 
Let me know, let me know everything's alright 
And when the busy day is done

You know exactly what I need and I always go to sleep in peace 
Thanking God that you belong to me, so 
Touch your woman 
Touch your woman 
Everything's gonna be alright

Touch your woman 
Let me know, let me know everything's alright"

952,Traveling Man,Dolly Parton,"The man I loved ran a salesman route
Selling goods from house to house
Now I knew my mama would never stand
For me stepping out with no traveling man
Mama bought things that he was a'selling
But mama didn't know and I sure wasn't telling
That behind her back I was making plans
To meet somewhere with that traveling man
Oh the traveling man was a good bit older
But a girl needs arms to hold her
Mama didn't know 'cause I didn't told her
But mama wouldn't understand
Me stepping out with a traveling man
Mama didn't allow me a'going courting
And I'd tell lies that I reckon I oughtn't
Oh but she'd a'give me the back a' her hand
If she'd a'seen me with that traveling man
So I tell my mama that I reckon I oughta
Go to the spring and fetch us some water
What mama didn't know is I had a plan
To meet down there with that traveling man
Now I make plans to run away
With that traveling man on a Saturday
Well Saturday's here and here I stand
And there goes my mama with that traveling man
Oh that traveling man was a two-time lover
He took my love then he took my mother
But I didn't know 'cause mama didn't told me and I don't understand
My mama running off with my traveling man
Mama, you know you oughtn't a'done that
You just like my daddy
He run off before I ever knowed him
You done run-off with my traveling man
And I really don't think I ever knowed you either
Oh there goes my mama with my traveling man
And I'm really gonna miss that traveling man

953,Try,Dolly Parton,"I have chased after rainbows
Ive captured one or two
Ive reached for the stars
And I have even held a few
Ive walked that lonesome valley
Topped the mountains, saw a sky
Ive laughed and I have cried
But I have always tried
'Cause Ive always been a dreamer
And dreams are special things
But dreams are of no value
If theyre not equipped with wings
So secure yourself for climbing
Make ready for the sky
Dont let your chance go by
Youll make it if you try
So try to be the first one up the mountain
The highest flying dreamer in the sky
And try your best to be an inspiration
Brothers that are still afraid and shy
And try to make the most of every moment
'Cause if you never try you never win
So try each day to try a little harder
And if you fail, get up and try again
You know nothing is impossible
If you can just believe
Dont live your life in shackles
When faith can be the key
The winner's one who keeps determination in his eyes
Whos not afraid to fly and not afraid to try
So try to be the first one up the mountain
And try to be the first to touch the sky
And dont let somebody tell you, you cant do it
And if they say that, show em its a lie
And if you fail at first just keep on trying
'Cause you are not a failure in gods eyes
So spread your wings and let the magic happen
Cause youll never really know if you dont try
And the first step is the one thats always hardest
But youll never really know if you dont try
You have to try"
954,Try Being Lonely,Dolly Parton,"Suppose you wanted someone the way I want you
Just imagine your body, mind and soul breaking in two
Walk the floor each night, shed tears you can't conceal
Just try being lonely, then you'll know just how I feel
I saw you with your new love and oh it hurt me so
Funny how I see your face everywhere I go
You smiled and looked to be so happy as you passed by
So I hurried around the corner so you wouldn't see me cry
Suppose you wanted someone the way I want you
Just imagine your body, mind and soul breaking in too
Walk the floor each night, shed tears you can't conceal
Just try being lonely, then you know just how I feel
Just try being lonely, then you know just how I feel"

958,Two Little Orphans,Dolly Parton,"Two little children a boy and a girl
Sat by and old church door

That fell on the dress that she wore
The little boys clothes were all tattered and torn
They shone beneath his blue eyes
Why don't you go home to your mommy I said
And this was the maidens reply
Mommy's is heaven angels took her away
Left Jim and I all alone
We've no one to love us daddy is dead
And our darling mother is gone
Mommy got sick angels took her away
To dwell in those matins so bright

The sexton came early to ring the church bell
And found them beneath the snow white
The angels made room for the orphans to dwell
Up in heaven with their mommy that night"

A thread of hope
For me to spend around you
Unlikely Angel
Standing there in front of me
As if you were my destiny
Like we were always meant to be together
Unlikely Angel
It feels so right inside your love
Like God has sent you from above
To honor, cherish, and to love forever
The smile upon your angel face
The heaven in your eyes replace
The hell that I've been going through
Before you
How long have you been there for me
I once was blind but now I see
A future full of hope
How I adore you
Unlikely Angel
Standing there in front of me
As if you were my destiny
Like we were always meant to be together

In sacred halls or crowded streets
But God has sent one straight down to me from heaven

964,Walls Of My Mind,Dolly Parton,"In grave in my mind there are pictures mem'ries of a love I knew one time
So I find in my thoughts I stand looking
At the mem'ries hanging on the walls of my mind
I see a mem'ry of raindrops falling in the park on the day we met
Walking with each other through the rain laughing talking as we both got soak and wet
The mem'ry made that day I could never put away
That's the day he told me he'd be mine
And that's just one of the mem'ries he left hanging on the wall of my mind
And I have a mem'ry of springtime cherry blossoms and bird singing on the vine
And the secret place we'd hide and laid together side by side
And the love that shined so brightly in his eyes
Springtime I recall was the sweetest time of all
That's the season our hearts became entwine
And that's just one of the mem'ries he left hanging on the wall of my mind
Through the spring and summer he loved me and his love died with autumn leaves
His love was the wild and restless kind
When he left he left with me so many memories
He left them hanging on the wall of my mind on my mind
Mhm mhm hanging on the wall of my mind on my mind
He left them hanging on my mind"

You done gone and broke my heart
Walter, Walter Henry
You know that I believed you
When you swore we'd never part
Well you said you had to have me
And well you dang well did
You took me from my country home
When I was just a kid
And you took me off to Boston
Put a baby on my knee
Left me to dangle-dingle
So far from Tennessee
Now Patrick might have been one
But you ain't been no saint
But a good ole' Irish boy
They say we'll always have this drink
And you just won't stop chasin'
All those other woman around
A' ramblin' and a'gamblin'
Throwin' Irish whiskey down

966,Wasting Love,Dolly Parton,"It seems we lost the feeling somewhere along the way
The distance now between us grows farther day by day
We never love each other we're just passing off the time
Wasting love yours and mine
Wasting love love divine wasting love yours and mine
There's nothing left between us just the ties that bind
Wasting love yours and mine wasting love
We just might find happiness with somebody new
For all the love we're wasting surely could be used
Not long ago our love was so true and kind
Now it's been wasted yours love and mine
Wasting love love divine...
Wasting love yours and mine wasting love"
967,Wayfaring Stranger,Dolly Parton,"I am a poor wayfaring stranger
While traveling through this world of woe
Yet there's no sickness, toil or danger
In that bright world to which I go
I'm going there to see my father
I'm going there no more to roam
I'm only going over Jordan
I'm only going over home
I know dark clouds will gather around me
I know my way is rough and steep
Yet beauteous fields lie just before me
Where God's redeemed their vigils keep
I'm going there to my mother
She said she'd meet me when I come
I'm only going over Jordan
I'm only going over me"
968,We Cant Let This Happen To Us,Dolly Parton,"Lately we're acting as if we were strangers
For a moment with each other we don't take time
With our work and busy schedules of things we think important
Seems we've left the most important things behind
And we can't let this happen to us
The hills that we climb may seem rough
And the mountains between could shadow our dreams
And we can't let this happen to us

We can't let this happen to us
We must cherish each smile and tender touch
For the castles we've built could all crumble to dust
And we can't let this happen to us
No we can't let this happen to us"
969,We Found It,Dolly Parton,"We've been a searching for the love that lost its feeling
That one time filled our hearts with fire with love revealing
We thought that love had gone never more to be returning
And the fire that we thought had gone out again is brightly burning
Oh we found it oh we found it yes we found it yeah we found it
Joy to love joy to love we found it
And the lights are way down low the fire of love is high
We found it yes we found it oh we found it oh we found it
Sweet love you and I

Well I never seen a lovelight shine so bright no wonder we found it
Shining like a neon light with love all around it
It's nights like this with love's sweet bliss sprinkled all around it
We cried a while but now we smile hmm hmm we found it
Oh we found it oh we found...
Oh we found it oh we found..."

971,We Had All The Good Things Going,Dolly Parton,"(Marvin Shiner - Jerry Monday)
It wasn't very long ago we had a love few people know
And everything was going oh so fine
I trusted you, you trusted me the way that it's supposed to be
But love slipped from us somewhere down the line.
Chorus:
We had all of the good things going baby
You know we did, everything was fine
Enjoying the taste of the good life
We all look for but few can find.

It's gone but we can't understand how luck could slip right through our hands
All down the line things seemed so very right
The love we shared through all these years we both knew that we were sincere
Then suddenly it left just overnight.
Chorus:
We had all of the good things going baby
You know we did, everything was fine
Enjoying the taste of the good life
We all look for but few can find.

Days that didn't seem so very long
Neither of us ought to blame we overly know that it's a shame
And all that we had going now is gone.

972,We Had It All,Dolly Parton,"I can hear the wind a blowin' in my mind
Just the way it use to sound through the Georgia pines
You were always there to answer when I'd call
You and me, we had it all
Remember how I use to touch your hair
Reaching for the feeling that was always there
You were the best thing in my life, I can recall
You and me, we had it all
I know that we can never live those times again
But I let my dreams take me back to where we've been
And I stay there with you just as long as I can
Oh it was so good
It was so good
It was so good when you were my man
But I'll never stop believing in your smile
Even though you didn't stay, it was all worth while
You were the best thing in my life I can recall
You and me, we had it all
I know that we could never get that far again
So I let these memories take me on back to where we've been
And I stay there with you just as long as I can

It was so good when you were my man
You were the best thing in my life I can recall
You and me, we had it all"
973,We Might Be In Love,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
I love you, I love you
My heart seems to whisper
But my lips cannot form those words
I know my heart
Is calling out to you
In a voice you've already heard
Does your heart feel as if
It could burst any second
Is it racing, will not slow up
Do you just want to be
With me endlessly
Well I'm thinking
We might be in love
We might be in love
The best I can tell
I thinkin' thoughts
That I've never pondered
And I'm feeling like I've never felt
It's like I drink
From some magic posion
Sipping from your loving cup
Intoxicated, infatuated
I'm thinking we might be in love
We might be in love
What else could it be
These feelings of wonder
Passion and romance
Excitement and pure ectasy
We might be in love
And it might be forever
I think there's a future for us
If you just want to be
In and all over me
It might be, we might be in love
I promise for keeps
If you're feeling like me
Then it might be
We might be in love
I dare say
We might be in love"

Crazy crazy we'd have to be crazy but you know I'm crazy about you
Either I'm crazy or you are one or maybe it's me and you
For we'd have to be crazy to live like this and go through what we go through
Well our love's so strong but we can't get along there's never a minute of peace
If I ain't a querrellin' and a fussin' at you you're a querrellin' and a fussin' at me
Crazy crazy we'd have to be crazy...
Well we must love to live like this in our subconscious minds
How can you love somebody so much and despite 'em at the very same time

Would you think all people could live like this we couldn't be too bright
Crazy crazy we'd have to be crazy..."

979,Were Through Forever Til Tomorrow,Dolly Parton,"(Blaise Tosti)
Love's a war we all survive, a never ending compromise
We always seem to say we're through, just to say tomorrow
Babe, I'm still in love with you
Every now and then we fight
So very sure we're both right
Saying things we never mean
Just to take them back tomorrow
And admit how wrong we've been
We're through forever 'til tomorrow
That's all we really seem to say
We can't go on with all this sorrow
We've got to find a better way
Many times we would fight and I would leave you
Then I'd find, just how much I really need you, and love you
Oh, oh, candle light, a glass of wine
Can bring back vision to the blind
Making love is sweet revenge
And when the battle's over
We're back in love, and we both win
We're through forever 'til tomorrow
That's all we really seem to say
From here, where is our love to go
And from us, what is left to say
Hey, hey, we're through forever 'til tomorrow
We're through forever 'til tomorrow
We're through forever 'til tomorrow
We're through forever 'til tomorrow"
980,What A Friend We Have In Jesus,Dolly Parton,"What a friend we have in Jesus
All our sins and grieves to bear
And what a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our burden share
We should never be discouraged
Take it to the Lord in prayer
What a friend we have in Jesus
All our sins and grieves to bear
And what a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer
What a friend we have in Jesus"
981,What A Heartache,Dolly Parton,"
I thought I saw the promise of forever in your eyes
I thought that I was sure of what I saw
You led me to believe that I was special in your life
So I left my heart wide open for the fall

What a heartache you turned out to be
What a heartache, what a heartache
Love ain't always what it appears to be
And what a heartache you turned out to be

I thought I'd found a safe and loving place inside your heart
And I was warm and willing anytime
The same soft lips that kissed me sweet were lying from the start
But I swear I thought your love was genuine

What a heartache you turned out to be
What a heartache, what a heartache
Like a switchblade that cuts so swift and deep
What a heartache you turned out to be

It just goes to show that you never can tell
I really thought that I knew you well
I still can't believe I could be deceived so easily
Are all these wishes I'm wishing to myself
Like rusty coins in a wishing well?
Wishes come true, they come false, as well
It's too late for you and me

Oh what a heartache, what a heartbreak
Love is two-faced and easy to believe
What a heartache, what a heartache
What a mistake to think that I could believe
What a heartache you turned out to be
Oh what a heartache you turned out to be"
982,What Aint To Be Just Might Happen,Dolly Parton,"I've learned to live my life just a little bit lighter
Gonna look on the lonely days just a little bit brighter
My heart's been throwed around and it ain't done enough laughin'
What is to be will be what ain't to be just might happen
It don't do no good to worry none just turns your hair gray while you're young
Love can make you sing start your hands a clappin'
What is to be will be what ain't to be just might happen
Why you can't never tell when love might find you
It could be miles away or right behind you
Some makes you hurt real bad some makes you happy
What is to be will be what ain't to be just might happen
Don't do no good to worry none...
I had a love one time sent me out on a ledge
Well it's fourteen stories high standin' on the edge

984,What Is It My Love,Dolly Parton,"You hurt me, you use me, you lie
You're heartless and hateful and cold
You don't care how you make me cry
You must have the last word
And be in control
What is it about you I love
You're selfish and stubborn and proud
You're arrogant, boastful and vain
You're careless and thoughtless and loud
A flirt and a tease
And you cause me such pain
What is it about you I love
What is it, what is it my love
Chorus:
There's something about you
That I seem to need
I have a hunger you know how to feed
And you satisfy me like nobody else
Those moments of heaven
Are worth all this hell
And I know you love me in your own crazy way
And I know you need me more than you can say
I may be a fool but I'll never give up
'Cause there's something about you I love
What is it, what is it my love
Chorus:
And there's something about me
That you seem to need
'Cause you have a hunger I know how to feed
And I satisfy you like nobody else
Those moments of heaven
Are worth all this hell
And I know in my heart that you want to be good
I understand that you're misunderstood
You're insecure and defensively tough
There's something about you my love
What is it, what is it my love
There's something about you
That I seem to need
What is it, what is it my love"
985,What Will Baby Be,Dolly Parton,"A young couple marries, already fighting
Along comes baby makin' them three
Trouble's all he hears from the time he's in didies
Baby don't know just what to believe
Angry words and spiteful actions
Baby's gonna cut his teeth on these
If that's gonna be the main attraction
What will the baby be, what will baby be
Baby needs love and needs direction
Baby's first school is the family
For they are only a reflection
Of the things they see, what will baby be
Chorus:
What will baby be after baby is grown
What will baby do if baby don't know what's right or wrong
Got to show them love, got to teach them truth
'Cause what baby is when baby grows up
Well, that depends entirely on me and you
Depends entirely on me and you
Baby thinks God is just a curse word
Never said a prayer 'cause he's never been taught
They remember and repeat what they've heard
So I ask who's really at fault
So many questions, so few answers
So many lessons we don't teach
Stumbling through like clumsy dancers
What will baby be, what will baby be
2nd Chorus:
What will baby be after baby is grown
What will baby do when baby is out there on his own
Teach the children how to be all they should be
'Cause what baby is when baby grows up
Depends entirely on you and me
Depends entirely on you and me
What will baby be"

You say there's no excitement now. Too bad you feel that way
Well, I wonder how exciting that your life will be alone
Oh, I know you may not want me now, but you'll miss me when I'm gone
Gone
You'll love me when I'm gone and then you'll realize just what I meant to you
You-oo-oo-oo
You'll miss me when I'm gone and then you'll realize how good I've been to you

989,When Jesus Comes Calling For Me,Dolly Parton,"When I was a child I recall and old man; everybody loved old Zeke
He was all alone, his family was gone; one day he said to me
I'm just sittin' here thinkin' about Jesus, rockin' as my old chair creaks
Some glad day I'll fly away when Jesus comes calling for me
It might be today, it might be tomorrow, maybe one day next week
I'll soon be done with trouble and sorrow when He comes calling for me
When Jesus comes calling for me
When I die don't grieve and cry
Lordy, don't feel sorry for me
Oh what a day, what a mighty fine day
When Jesus comes calling for me
When He comes calling for me
I might be in the graveyard walking talking to my family
Or I might be plowing in the field down yonder, just old Muley and me
Wherever I am, whatever I'm a doing, some sweet day I'll see
And band of angels in a cloud of glory when Jesus comes calling for me
When He comes calling for me
When I die just close my eyes
And lay me 'neath the willow tree
Oh what a day, what a mighty fine day
When Jesus comes calling for me
When Jesus comes calling for me
I'm just sittin' here watchin' for Jesus, rockin' as my old chair creaks
Some sweet day I'll fly away when Jesus comes calling for me
When He comes calling for me"

991,When Life Is Good Again,Dolly Parton,"When life is good again
I'll be a better friend
A bigger person when
Life is good again
More thoughtful than I've been
I'll be so different then
More in the moment when
Life is good again
I'll open up my heart
And let the whole world in
I'll try to make amends
When life is good again
We've been brought to our knees
We've been so ill at ease
There are no guarantees
But you know life goes on
This too shall pass away
Bring new and different days
We need to change our ways
And right our wrongs
Let's open up our hearts
And let the whole world in
Let's try to make amends
When life is good again
I'll open up my doors again
And hear the message in the wind
Repent of all my sins
(Hallelujah)
When life is good again
I'll try to be someone
On which you can depend
A helping hand to lend
Let's open up our eyes
To see what's goin' on
If we're to move along,
From where we've been
Let's open up our hearts
And let the love shine in
(Shine in)
We've all got knees to bend
And we'll just pray till then
Ask God's forgiveness when
Life is good again
And it's gonna be good again
(It's gonna be)
(It's gonna be)
It's gonna be good again
It'll be alright
(It'll be alright)
God's the reason for all things
You want rainbows
You get rain
We'll all be forever changed
I'll sell my boat and fly my kite
Walk in the park
Go out at night
And hold my loved ones extra tight
When everything is on the mend
I'll even drink with my old friends
Sing and play my mandolin
We'll make it through this long dark night
Darkness fades when faced with light
But everything's gonna be alright when life is good again"
992,When Possession Gets Too Strong,Dolly Parton,"I can't live with you when you try to own me
Though you may give me love like I have never known
But if you try to control me then you won't never know me
And I'll be movin' on when possession gets too strong
So love me just for what I am don't try to change a thing
And I'll take you just like you are and I'll expect the same
So if you want to love me you must understand all of me
For I'll be movin' on when possession gets too strong
And I have no control over what I feel inside
And I can't change the way I am and you must be satisfied

993,When Someone Wants To Leave,Dolly Parton,"When you love somebody with all your heart and soul
And you want to keep them with you, but you know they want to go
What do you do, what do you say
When you know they want to leave
As bad as you want them to stay
And there's nothing quite as sad as a one-sided love
When one doesn't care at all and the other cares too much
It's a sad situation, I must say
When you know they want to leave
As bad as you want them to stay
You know how much I love you
But I know you don't love me
And I know it's just a matter of time before you leave
But I do, I stand aside and just let you walk away
But I know you want to leave
As bad as I want you to stay
And there's nothing quite as sad as a one-sided love
When one doesn't love at all and the other loves too much

994,When The Sun Goes Down Tomorrow,Dolly Parton,"Thumbing for a ride by the edge of the road
With a brown paper bag to hold my clothes
But tonight I'm going home where I belong
If the good lord's willing and the creek don't rise
And if my luck holds out, and I catch me a ride
When the sun goes down tomorrow, I should be home
This big city ain't no kind of place
For a country girl with a friendly face
If you smile people look at your funny, they take it wrong
They laugh at my talkin' and clothes I wear
They put me down and they call me square
But tonight I'm going home where I belong
Chorus:
I'm goin' back to the people I love
Back to the place that I dream of
It's true that there's no place like home sweet home
The one I want to see the most
Is the boy who begged me not to go
When the sun goes down tomorrow
Tag:
Tonight I'm going back where I belong"
995,When Were Gone Long Gone,Dolly Parton,"Trouble, we have known trouble
In our struggle just to get by
Many times the burden's been heavy
Still we carried on side by side

And when we're gone long gone
The only thing that will have mattered
Is the love that we shared
And the way that we cared
When we're gone, long gone
And when we're walking together in glory
Hand in hand through eternity
It's the love that will be remembered
Not wealth, not poverty

Longer than time
I wanna know your dreams
And make them mine

Only for you
All the impossible
I wanna do
I wanna hold you close under the rain
I wanna kiss your smile
And feel your pain
I know what's beautiful
Looking at you
Here in a world of lies
You are the true
And baby
Everytime you touch me
I become a hero
I'll make you safe no matter where you are
And bring you
Anything you ask for
Nothing is above me
I'm shining like a candle in the dark
When you tell me that you love me
I wanna make you see
Just what I was
Show you the loneliness
And what it does
You walked into my life
To stop my tears
Everything's easy now
I have you here
Repeat In a world without you
I would always hunger
All I need is your love to make me stronger

Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my love will be yours always
Whenever forever comes, when all things are said and done
I'll still be feeling the same way I do
I'll be there for you and still wanting you
God gave you to me, and me to you
And you will still be the one whenever forever comes
We'll float on a cloud through eternity

I'll give you the moon and we'll replace the sun
Whenever forever comes, whenever forever comes"

999,Where Beauty Lives In Memory,Dolly Parton,"She stands before the mirror
Smiles at her reflection
Striking sexy poses in the glass
She paints her lips a brilliant red
Piles her hair high on her head
Struggles to replace a false eyelash
She powders up her face
Paints her cheeks to match her lips
She wears a dress cut low in the front
Fittin' tight around her hips
And there inside her room
She stands and gazes at herself
Where beauty lives in memory
She lives in fairy tales
Chorus:
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the fairest of them all
She sings as she goes waltzing' cross the floor
She keeps a candle burning
And she waits for his returning
When beauty lives in memory
It lives forevermore
She was a fairy princess once
And was by all adored
They say she was the fairest of them all
They called her Cinderella
And they say that every fella
Would gladly answer to her beck and call
So the story went
They tell of how this handsome prince
Stole her heart and wandered far away
He took her heart and took her mind
Now she has lost all track of time
Forty years has passed and still she waits singing
Repeat Chorus
Meanwhile back inside her room
The shads are pulled it's half past noon
But in her mind why it's forty years ago
She recalls the beauty of their love
She remembers he was beautiful
And of course she always knew she was
And so the past unfolds
And all at once inside her mind
She sees him at the door
And as he's leading her away
She feels the room begin to sway
Where beauty lives in memory
She falls dead upon the floor
Repeat Chorus"
1000,Where Do The Children Play,Dolly Parton,"Well I think it's fine, building jumbo planes.
Or taking a ride on a cosmic train.
Switch on summer from a slot machine.
Get what you want to if you want, 'cause you can get anything.
I know we've come a long way,
We're changing day to day,
But tell me, where do the children play?
Well you roll on roads over fresh green grass.
For your lorryloads pumping petrol gas.
And you make them long, and you make them tough.
But they just go on and on, and it seems you can't get off.
Oh, I know we've come a long way,
We're changing day to day,
But tell me, where do the children play?
When you crack the sky, scrapers fill the air.
Will you keep on building higher
'til there's no more room up there?
Will you make us laugh, will you make us cry?
Will you tell us when to live, will you tell us when to die?
I know we've come a long way,
We're changing day to day,
But tell me, where do the children play?"

Hope with a gentle persuasion whispers her comforting word
Wait till the darkness is over, wait till the tempest is gone

Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice
Whispering hope, oh how welcome thy voice
Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice"

Just like the ones I used to know

With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all
Your Christmases be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright

May all your Christmases
May all your Christmases
May all your Christmases be white

Christmas with you

Dressed up and feelin' good
Eyes full of stars
A heart full of dreams
Daisy Mae in Hollywood
Struttin' down the boulevard
The walkway of the stars
With a vision of her name in lights
Reflectin' off the cars
And dreamin' of a white limozeen
She wants to have a white limozeen
Well the days to come were long and dark
And the nights were hard and cold
She met the devil in the City Of Angels
But she never lost her soul
She kept her dreams close to her heart
Like a family photograph
She cried sometimes and died sometimes
But still knew how to laugh
Dreamin' of a white limozeen
Dreamin' of a white limozeen

Now she's a livin' her dreams
Like a movie queen
Diamond rings and all things good

White limozeen
White limozeen

She's a woman of the world
But deep inside she never changed
She's the same old down home girl
And when the airplane brings the kinfolk
To visit for awhile
There's a friendly guy in a red bow tie
To take 'em around in style
He drives 'em in a white limozeen
She finally got a white limozeen
Chorus:
Now she's a livin' her dreams
Like a movie queen
Diamond rings and all things good

Why did you walk out on me?
Cry, cry, cry I feel like I could die

1006,Why Cant We,Dolly Parton,"Look how the wind carries the seed
See how the soil supplies what it needs
The rain falls, the sun shines and a flower breaks free
And it all works together, why can't we
And I have seen children at play in the park
Skin shades of ivory, red, yellow and dark
Well, my eyes saw colors their little hearts could not see
They were playing together, why can't we
Chorus:
Why can't we, why can't we
I can love you and you can love me
Why can't we, why can't we
Set our foolish pride free, just be and let be
Why can't we

They were playing together and there was peace in the land
And swords became plowshares 'cause there were no enemies
And I woke up and wondered, God why can't we
Repeat Chorus
Tag:
Set our foolish pride free, just be and let be
Why can't we, M-M-M-M
Why can't we"
1007,Whyd You Come In Here Lookin Like That,Dolly Parton,"Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
In your cowboy boots and your painted-on jeans
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream
Why'd you come in here looking like that
Here comes my baby draggin' my heart behind
He's drivin' me crazy who says love is blind
He's got a wanderin' eye and a travelin' mind
Big ideas and a little behind
Out with a different woman every night
But I remember when he was mine
Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
In your high heeled boots and your painted-on jeans
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream
Waltzing right in here lookin' like that
Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
When you could stop traffic in a gunny sack
Why you're almost givin' me a heart attack
When you waltz right in here lookin' like that
I just can't stand it to see him on the town
He's out slow dancing with every girl around
I'm a softhearted woman he's a hardheaded man
And he's gonna make me feel just as bad as he can
He's got himself a mean streak a half a mile wide
But now he's dancing on this heart of mine
Oh why'd you come in here lookin' like that
In your high heeled boots and your painted-on jeans
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream
Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
In your cowboy boots and your painted-on jeans
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream
Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
When you could stop traffic in a gunny sack
Why you're almost givin' me a heart attack
When you waltz right in here lookin' like that
Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
Why'd you come in here lookin' like that"
1008,Why Why Why,Dolly Parton,"Why, why, why did you say goodbye?
Why did you walk out on me?
Cry, cry, cry I feel like I could die
Why did you go and leave me lonely?
What did I do? What did I say?
Make you just walk out and leave me this way
Please, come back and tell me
What I did wrong? And I'll make it up to you
If you'll just come back home
I'll try, try, try as each day goes by
Make you glad that you came back to me
No more goodbyes and no more tears to cry
Everyday I'll try to make you happy
What did I do? What did I say
Make you just walk out and leave me this way
Please, come back and tell me
What I did wrong? And I'll make it up to you
If you'll just come back home
I'll try, try, try as each day goes by
Make you glad that you came back to me
No more goodbyes and no more tears to cry
Everyday I'll try to make you happy"
1009,Wild Texas Wind,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
Don't ask me if I'm crying
Can't you see it ain't raining
No, this ain't sand in my eyes
Before it has been spoken
When one good heart gets broken
That's enough to make a cowgirl cry
Cause here I am, all by myself
My man he just up and left
He said he would never try again
Now the thing that hurts me most
When he makes up his mind to go
He'll be gone, like a wild texas wind
Chorus:
Like a wild texas wind
Oh my man is gone again
I feel lonesome settin' in
Like a wild texas wind
Like a Wild Texas Wind
Oh my man is gone, he's gone, he's gone again
I feel lonesome sittin' in
Like a wild texas wind
Hmmmm"
1010,Wildest Dreams,Dolly Parton,"Let's drink a toast to what might have been
To all that we were, but can't be again
And let's just be thankful we parted as friends
Here's to the past, let the future begin
Chorus:
Oh, and here's to you wildest dreams
And here's to your everything
May your life be blessed with sweet happiness
Baby, here's to your wildest dreams
I made a promise that I wouldn't cry
You go chase your rainbows, go on reach for the sky
But come hold me close now, look deep in my eyes
Tell me you love me, then kiss me goodbye
Repeat Chorus
I'll always love you and I'm on your side
In whatever you do, I will take pride
Repeat Chorus
Tag:
Baby, here's to your wildest dreams
Dreams, dream on, baby"
1011,Wildflowers,Dolly Parton,"The hills were alive with wildflowers
And I was as wild, even wilder than they
For at least I could run, they just died in the sun
And I refused to just wither in place
Just a wild mountain rose, needing freedom to grow
So I ran fearing not where I'd go
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
And the flowers I knew in the fields where I grew
Were content to be lost in the crowd
They were common and close, I had no room for growth
I wanted so much to branch out
I uprooted myself from home ground and left
Took my dreams and I took to the road
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
I grew up fast and wild and I never felt right
In a garden so different from me
I just never belonged, I just longed to be gone
So the garden, one day, set me free
Hitched a ride with the wind and since he was my friend
I just let him decide where we'd go
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow"
1012,Will He Be Waiting,Dolly Parton,"I can still see that lonesome road stretched out before me
The road that left me out of his love
I can still feel the tears he cried on my shoulder the day that I told him goodbye
I never should have left him never should have gone oh what a crazy fool I've been
Will he be waiting for me he will be won't he and will he take me back again
Shadows from the streets shade the path that I am walking
As I make my way back up that winding road again
And the smell of my tomorrow fills the air with sweet perfume
My heart beats faster as I'm near my journey're end
I wonder if he's missed me I wonder if he wants me I wonder does he love me still
Will he be waiting for me he will be won't he oh how I hope he will
He will be waiting for me he will be won't he
How could it be his love for me has faded and has died
He will be waiting for me he will be won't he
Oh will I find that this time I'll be the one to cry
Will he be waiting for me"
1013,Will He Be Waiting For Me,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
I can still see that lonesome road stretched out before me 
The road that led me out of his life 
I can still feel the tears he cried on my shoulder 
The day that I told him good-bye 
I never should'a left him 
Never should'a gone 
Oh what a crazy fool I've been 
Will he be waiting for me 
He will be, won't he 
And will he take me back again 
He will be waiting for me 
He will be, won't he 
Or could it be his love for me has faded and has died 
He will be waiting for me 
He will be, won't he 
Or will I find that this time 
I'll be the one to cry 
Shadows from the trees 
Shade the path that I am walkin' 
As I make my way back up that windy road again 
The smell of mountain laurel fills the air with sweet perfume 
My heart beats faster as I near my journey's end 
I wonder if he missed me 
Wonder if he wants me 
I wonder does he love me still 
Will he be waiting for me 
He will be, won't he 
Oh how I hope he will 
He will be waiting for me 
He will be, won't he 
Or could it be his love for me has faded and has died 
He will be waiting for me 
He will be, won't he 
Or will I find that this time 
I'll be the one to cry 
He will be waiting for me 
He will be, won't he 
Or could it be his love for me has faded and has died 
He will be waiting for me 
He will be, won't he 
Or will I find that this time 
I'll be the one to cry 
Cry, mmmm"
1014,Winter Wonderland Sleigh Ride,Dolly Parton,"(Felix Bernard - Richard Smith / Mitchell Parish - Leroy Anderson)
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening in the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight, walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird, here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song, as we go along, walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman and pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, are you married, we'll say, no man
But you can do the job when you're in town
Later on, we'll conspire as we dream by the fire
The face unafraid, oh, the plans that we made walking in a winter wonderland.
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring-ting-tingling too
C'mon, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling yoo-hoo(yoo-hoo)
C'mon, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.
In the meadow we can build a snowman and pretend that he is Parson Brown
Wen he say, are you married, we'll say, no man,
But you can do the job when you're in town
Later on, we'll conspire as we dream by the fire
The face unafraid, the plans that we made walking in a winter wonderland.
To face unafraid the plans that we've made walking in a winter wonderland.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh baby, c'mon and walk with me
Oh, why don't you
Walk along, talk along, sing along all night
Oh, why don't you
Walk along, talk along, sing along all night
Oh baby
Walk along, talk along, sing along all night..."
1015,With Bells On,Dolly Parton,"I'll be home with bells on, I'll be home with bells on
Trim the tree and wrap the presents, turn the Christmas music on
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on.
I've traveled around this country crossed the waters deep and wide
Made lots of friends and memories brought joy to other's lives
It's Christmas time again another year has come and gone
And I can't keep from wonderin' how the old folks are at home.
'Cause I'll be home with bells on, I'll be home with bells on
Trim the tree and wrap the presents turn the Christmas music on
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on.
--- Instrumental ---
When the snow is on the meadow and the sleigh bells jingle bright
And the kids are singing jingle bells around the Christmas lights
As daddy stokes the fire and mama puts the turkey on
There ain't nothing going to slow me down this Christmas I'll be home.
Yeah, I'll be home with bells on, I'll be home with bells on
Trim the tree and wrap the presents turn the Christmas music on
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on.
Yeah, I'll be home with bells on, I'll be home with bells on
Trim the tree and wrap the presents turn the Christmas music on
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on..."
1016,With You Gone,Dolly Parton,"Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, what will do I with you gone?
Sitting in my lonely room just staring at the wall
For lack of something else to do I count the tears that fall
Trying to get it through my head you don't care at all
What am I gonna do with you gone?
What does life hold for me anymore?
With you gone what once mattered don't matter no more
You still have the key to my heart and my door
What am I gonna do with you gone, with you gone?
I can hear the lonesome whistle of a passing train
I can feel my heart beat a rhythm with the pouring rain
Realizing that my life won't ever be the same
What am I gonna do with you gone?
Will I ever be happy again?
With you gone my whole world has just come to an end
Will I ever forget you, or will I forget
What am I gonna do with you gone, with you gone?
With you gone, What does life hold for me anymore?
With you gone what once mattered don't matter no more
And you still have the key to my heart and my door
What am I gonna do with you gone, with you gone?
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, what will do I with you gone?"
1017,Working Girl,Dolly Parton,"(Dolly Parton)
Some men find her sexy, some men disagree 
But if she's not, it's not because she doesn't want to be 
She wears a push-up bra from Freddericks, five inch high heel shoes 
Maybelline and Rubinstein, and Avon's best perfume 
She's a working girl 
She's a working girl, she is single and free 
She's a mother and wife and she's proud to be 
A working girl 
Some find her to aggressive, she don't know how to stop 
Cause she's the kind that don't look down until it's from the top 
She's elegant and stylish, French perfume and a fur 
Designer clothes by Halston and Diane Von Furstenburg 
And she's a working girl 
She's a working girl, she is single and free 
She's a mother and wife and she's proud to be 
A working girl 
She has taken her place among the tallest of trees 
But she weeps like a willow when she's brought to her knees 
Cause she's a working girl 
You'll find her dressed according to standard uniform 
Cause she must dress in comfort for the job she must perform 
She has so many faces, she wears so many names 
She goes so many places and she does so many things 
Cause she's a working girl 
She's a working girl, she is single and free 
She's a mother and wife and she's proud to be 
A working girl 
She's a working girl, she is single and free 
She's a mother and wife and she's proud to be 
A working girl 
She's a working girl, she is single and free 
She's a mother and wife and she's proud to be 
A working girl"
1018,Wouldnt It Be Great,Dolly Parton,"Wouldn't it be fine if you could say you love me
Just one time with a sober mind?
Wouldn't that be fine, now wouldn't that be fine?
Wouldn't it be great if you could love me first
And let the bottle wait?
Now wouldn't that be great, now wouldn't that be great?
Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?
Throw the old glass crutch away and watch it break
Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?
Lord, it's for our sake, wouldn't that be great?
In the name of love, what's the man so great?
Keep thinking of what a man he was
In the name of love, in the name of love
Love went away when the sexy lace wouldn't turn his face
The bottle took my place, love went to waste
Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?
Wouldn't it be good? And I know
You could if you just would
Wouldn't that be good? And you know you should
Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?"
1019,Yellow Roses,Dolly Parton,"Hello you said the day we met
Handing me a yellow rose
You asked me out
And to your surprise
And to mine I said I'd go
I thought it so romantic
And I found you sweet and bold
Though we'd only met
I still said yes
To a single yellow rose
And for years to come
You were the one
To sleep with me at night
To laugh and talk
And share my thoughts
And hold me when I'd cry
And on every occasion
And for no good reason to
A big bouquet or a single yellow rose
Was sent from you
Chorus:
Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go
Yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds
I still love you so
I never see a yellow rose
That I didn't think of you
It's still my favorite flower
Though the yellow's turned to blue
The day you left my teardrops fell
Upon your farewell not
You said goodbye like you said hello
With a single yellow rose
Chorus:
Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go
Yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds
Oh I still love you so
Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go
Sweet yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds
I still love you so"
1020,Yes I See God,Dolly Parton,"Writer Dorothy Jo Hope
From album Golden Streets of Glory
Copyright 1970
Yes I see God where the mountains reach the sky
And I see God when the eagle starts to fly
I see God in a little baby's smile I see God and he makes my life worthwhile
Yes I see God when the bridegroom meets his bride 
I see God in a father's loving eyes
I see God when a mother starts to cry I see God in a love that never dies
(I see God) where the people meet to pray (I see God) in the things they do and 
say
(I see God) when the little children play 
I see God and I know he's near all way
I see God yes I see God"
1021,You And Me Her And Him,Dolly Parton,"You and me and her and him must get together
And see if maybe we can find a way
To put an end to hurting one another
Cause he don't know and she don't know how much we hurt each day
It's not fair and you and I both know it
To have to hide and love the way we do
The time is now that we must get together
Her and him me and you

She and I had lost it long before I met you
We tried and tried but all the love had gone
And I guess respect is all that's kept me with him
Cause there hasn't been no love there in so long
It's not fair and you and I both know it...
Her and him me and you"
1022,You Are,Dolly Parton,"Sometimes I try to count the ways and reasons that I love you
But I can never seem to count that far
I love you in a million ways and for a million reasons
But more than this I love you as you are
More than this I love you just as you are
You are my inspiration, you are the song I sing
You are what makes me happy, you are my everything
You are my daily sunshine, you are my ev'ning star
Ev'rything I'd ever hoped to find, that's what you are
Ev'rything I'll ever want for 'mine', is what you are
You are my thoughts when I'm awake, and my dreams when I'm asleep
You are the reason for my smile, you are the words I speak
Every role I play in life you play the leading part
Ev'rything I'll ever want or need, is what you are
The only one I'l ever want for me, that's what you are
You are my inspiration, you are the song I sing
You are what makes me happy, you are my everything
You are my daily sunshine, you are my ev'ning star
Ev'rything I ever had in mind, is what you are
The only one I'l ever want for 'mine', that's what you are
You are my inspiration, you are the song I sing
You are what makes me happy, you are my everything
You are my daily sunshine, you are my ev'ning star
Ev'rything I'd ever hoped to find, that's what you are
Ev'rything I'll ever want for 'mine', is what you are
Ah, I love you
Ah, I love you just as you are
Ah, I love you, I love you
Ah"
1023,You Cant Make Old Friends,Dolly Parton,"What will I do when you are gone?
Who's gonna tell me the truth?
Who's gonna finish the stories I start,
The way you always do?
When somebody knocks at the door,
Someone new walks in.
I will smile and shake their hands,
but you can't make old friends.
You can't make old friends
Can't make old friends
It was you and me, since way back when.
But you can't make old friends.
How will I sing when you are gone?
Cause it wont sound the same.
Who will join in on those harmony parts,
When I call your name?
You can't make old friends
Can't make old friends
It was you and me, since way back when.
But you can't make old friends.
When Saint Peter opens the gate,
And you come walking in.
I will be there just waiting for you.
Cause you can't make old friends
Cause you can't make old friends.
When I am out on the stage all alone
And I hear the music begin.
We all know the show must go on.
But you can't make old friends.
You can't make old friends.
Can't make old friends
And you and me, will be young again.
You can't make old friends.
You and me, will be together again.
Cause we both know, we will still be old friends.
You can't make old friends
Not the way we have always been."
1024,You Cant Reach Me Anymore,Dolly Parton,"You can't reach me anymore
You say I'm not the girl that you remember
You say that I hve changed so much and you can't seem to rach me
Well you destroyed everything I used to be before and you can't reach me anymore
I was looked up to you while you were looking down
It used to turn me off inside when you would turn me down
Now you want the love from me that you destroyed before
But you can't reach me anymore
Now you say you love me more than anything
I used to love you that way now I don't feel a thing
The love that once lived in my heart don't live there anymore
And you can't reach me anymore
I was looked up to you while you were looking down
It used to turn me off when you would turn me down
Love that once lived in my heart it don't live there anymore
And you can't reach me anymore oh oh oh no you can't reach me anymore"

Slow Dancing With The Moon
(you Got Me Over) A Heartache Tonight
Can't say we're lovers, can't say we're friends
Don't even know if i'll see you again
But against your warm body i felt so alive
And you got me over a heartache tonight
My heart was broken, my hurt was deep
I had lost something i wanted to keep
Lookin' for comfort when you caught my eye
And you got me over a heartache tonight
Sweet conversation, a drink and a dance
Led to an evening of making romance
And i don't even care if it's wrong or it's right
'cause you got me over a heartache tonight
2nd
Yes, you got me over a heartache tonight
Stirring up passion brought me back to life
Oh, and it may not last, but who know it just might
But you got me over a heartache tonight
Yes, you got me over a heartache tonight"
1026,You Gotta Be My Baby,Dolly Parton,"Oh you said you were my baby
Now I know that you're my baby
But it seems to be you got roamin' eyes
If you wanna be my baby
Then you gotta be my baby
You can't keep your finger in two different lives
I remember how you pleaded
When my love you said you needed
And I believe without a doubt
So if you wanna be my baby
Then you gotta be my baby
And keep those kissin' cousins out
Oh you know how when I said I was a'rollin' low?
I get suspicious and I'm a'gonna tell you so
If you wanna be my baby
Then you gotta be my baby
And be nobody's baby but mine
Speaking:
Just think about it
Now I heard there was another
So I went and asked your mother
If anybody hung around besides me
She gave me no satisfaction
And now I can't take no action
But I think I'll hang around and see
If you wanna be my baby
Then you gotta be my baby
You gotta come to me and tell me so
If you wanna be my baby
Then you gotta be my baby
I'm tired of waitin' around so let them know
Oh how when I said that I'm a Rollin low
I'm gunna get suspicious and I'm gunna tell you so
If you wanna be my baby
Then you gotta be my baby
And be nobody's baby but mine
I said and be nobody's baby but mine

1027,Youll Always Be Special To Me,Dolly Parton,"To you I may never be more than a friend
But you'll always be special to me
To you I may never be closer than I am
But you'll always be special to me
Maybe I set my sights too high to be real
I may be wrong, but love is strong
And I can't hide how I feel
To you I may never be closer than I am
But you'll always be special to me
Maybe I set my sights too high to be real
But love is strong, I may be wrong
But I can't hide how I feel
To you I may never be closer than I am
But you'll always be special to me"
1028,Youll Never Be The Sun,Dolly Parton,"(Donagh Long)
You'll never be the sun turning in the sky
And you won't be the moon above us on a moonlit night
And you won't be the stars in heaven
Although they burn so bright
But even on the deepest ocean
You will be the light
You may not always shine
As you go barefoot over stone
You might be so long together
Or you might walk alone
And you won't find that love comes easy
But that love is always right

So even when the dark clouds gather
You will be the light
And if you lose the part inside
When loves turns round on you
Leaving the past behind
Is knowing you'll do like you always do
Holding you blind, keeping you true
You'll never be the sun turning in the sky
And you won't be the moon above us on a moonlit night
And you won't be the stars in heaven
Although they burn so bright
But even on the deepest ocean
You will be the light"
1029,Youre Gonna Be Sorry,Dolly Parton,"Some day you're gonna want me but I ain't gonna be around
Some day you'll find you miss the kiss that you're forever turnin' down
When you decide you want the love that once you could've had
Well that's gonna be to bad and you're gonna be sorry
You're gonna be sorry for all the dirty deals you've handed me
All the nights you stayed away you wished you'd spent with me
While you were busy makin' out, I was busy makin' plans for checkin' out
And when you find this out, you're gonna be sorry
You'll wake up cryin for me like I've done so many nights for you
You'll walk the floor and you'll call my name but I ain't gonna hear you
You'll curse the night and you'll hate yourself for ever doin' me wrong
But I'm gonna be long gone and you're gonna be sorry
You're gonna be sorry for all the dirty deals you've handed me
All the nights you've stayed away you wished you'd spent with me
While you were busy makin' out, I was busy makin' plans for checkin' out
And when you find I'm gone, you're gonna be sorry
You're gonna be sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry"
1030,Youre The One That Taught Me How To Swing,Dolly Parton,"You were not content with me when I was like I used to be
I was too old-fashioned, too simple and too plain
And so you took this country girl, taught me all about the world
Yes, you're the one that taught me how to swing
I used to never drink or smoke, I'd even blush at dirty jokes
I never wanted to take part in all those worldly games
But you dressed me up in sexy clothes, took me where the swingers go
Yes, you're the one that taught me how to swing
But you don't want me swingin' now, but you're the one that taught me how
It was you that wanted me to change
I'm only what you made of me - your mistake was changin' me
Yes, you're the one that taught me how to swing
You want me like I was before, but I'm not like that anymore
This plain old simple country girl won't ever be the same
So don't expect me to go back 'cause it's a bit too late for that
An' you're the one that taught me how to swing
But you don't want me swingin' now, but you're the one that taught me how
It was you that wanted me to change
And I'm only what you made of me - your mistake was changin' me
And, you're the one that taught me how to swing
Yes, you're the one that taught me how to swing
Taught me how to swing"
1031,Youre The Only One,Dolly Parton,"I found out the hard way
And I'm never gonna break your heart
I know, too late
And I don't want to break your heart
Guess I had to go away just to find
What I left behind
You're the only one
You're the only one
Take me back
To where we started from
And let's make it now
Like we made it then
This ol' heart ain't gonna break your heart again
Nights I lay in bed
And your covers wouldn't warm my feet
And morning found me
Bitter or a bit too sweet
Oh baby, I had to go away
Just to run back and say
You're the only one
You're the only one
Take me back
To where we started from
Can we make it now
Like we made it then
This ol' heart ain't gonna break your heart again
You're the only one darlin'
They'll never be anyone else but you
I love you so much
You are my love, you've become my life
And I never meant to break your heart
But, sometimes, you just got to go away
To find what you left behind
You're the only one
You're the only one
Take me back
To where we started from
Can we make it now
Like we make it then?
This ol' heart ain't gonna break your heart again
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
The only one
So take me back
To where we started from
You're the only one
The only one
You're the only one
You 're the only one

You're the only one
You're the only one
The only one"
1032,Youre The Only One I Ever Needed,Dolly Parton,"Every time you talk about your love
We always end up in the deepest despair
Cause you're so afraid you won't ever have enough
Even though I say it's gonna be there
You may not be good at taking chances
But don't be afraid to win or lose
You don't know who you want to romance with
But you wouldn't be feelin' blue
If you knew what you put me through
Chorus:
You're the only one that I ever needed
You're the only one that I ever cared for
You're the only one that I ever needed
You're the only one that I ever cared for
Everywhere I look, I see you
And I do all I can to keep it that way
But even now when you're trying to believe me
A miracle of tears gets in the way
You may not be good at taking chances
But don't be afraid to win or lose
You don't who you want to romance with
But you wouldn't be feelin' blue
If you knew what you put me through
Repeat Chorus Twice
Repeat Chorus To Fade"
1033,Your Kisses Are Charity,Dolly Parton,"(G. O' Dowd, R. Hay, M. Craig & J. Moss)
Last night you breathed the deepest sigh
Turned away with those gold cold cool eyes
You said won't you give me space to breathe
But my tears gave you confidence to leave
Now you say I'm just too much for you
There are things you'll never know
If you lie and cheat so easily
Ya better go, you better go
Go, go, go, you better go
All I know is how I feel
And my heart is always yours to steal
But you take and never give to me
Your kisses are charity
Your kisses are charity
Yesterday you were my brightest star
But even when you're near
I don't know where you are
I was wrong to show my weaker side
Now it's much too late to cry, cry, cry
I was blind to put my trust in you
If you leave me, I'll fall apart
Did you plan to make a fool out of me
From the start, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All I know is how I feel
And my heart was always yours to steal
But you take and never give to me
Your kisses are charity
Your kisses are charity
Now you say I'm too much for you
There are things you'll never know
If you lie and cheat so easily
Ya better go, you better go
Go, go, go, you better go
All I know is how I feel
And my heart was always yours to steal
But you take and never give to me
Your kisses are charity
You never give to me
All I know is how I feel
And my heart was always yours to steal
But you take but never give to me
Your kisses are charity
Your kisses are charity"

1039,Be Careful,Cardi B,"Yeah
Be careful, be careful, be careful with me
Look
I wanna get married, like the Curry's, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly; Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout liking pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though
Trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you're out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
Don't make me sick, nigga
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me
Do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me
Care for me, care for me
Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me
Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look
I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune,
but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this love's got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name
Watch her, 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's plain disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we start switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me
Do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?

Dreams filling up, I'm like skrrt

I seen the car I wanted, then I went and paid for it, cash cash
Hit the Tay-K, I hit the race, hit the dash dash
That's when they came for me on Twitter with the backlash
""Cardi B is so problematic"" is the hashtag

They talkin' junk and they stink, these hoes mad trash

Don't be mad because she havin' shit you had to try whole life
We had baggage on our flight, we had badges on our asses
You got passes in your life, you had gadgets on your bike

But never did I change, never been ashamed
Never did I switch, story stayed the same
I did this on my own, I made this a lane
Y'all gotta bare with me, I been through some things
Went from small-ass apartments to walkin' red carpets
Pissy elevators, now every dress is tailored
This some real-life fairy tale Binderella shit
I got further than them hoes said I will ever get
And that only goes to show that only God knows
I took pictures with Beyoncé, I met Mama Knowles
I'm the rose that came from the concrete in the Rolls

Un show mío lo que tú haces en un año entero (año entero)
Si me ves no me saludes, tú y yo no somos amigas (ah-hah, nope)
Si tú no haces dinero tú no eres de la mía (bah)
¿Dique que tú crees que tú puedes contra mi? Suelta eso bi
Nigga, please, to mis show son pago, ninguno gratis
Créeme a mí, no hagas que yo coja aquí un felony
I'm the big beef for well, these niggas know my pedigree
Honestly, I got bad bitches that wanna fuck with me
Suck on me, ride me crazy y dejarme seco a mi
Que yo no taba' sonando, que no taba' haciendo bulla
Disque que estaba apaga'o y pega'o con la jeva tuya (¡Ay!)
Ando con mi primo Lucas, un corito sano y con pa'l de putas
Lo que tu gasta' una noche en botellas
Eso yo lo ga'to en refilles de hooka
Lo cueros dicen Messiah ta' de pinga
Porque nos da y después se embala
A lo mejor ella pensaba que yo iba a darle y después mudarla
Andamo' en la calle, osea en la yesca (skrrr)
Andamo' fumando  purple haze en mi yelba
Hablan mierda a tu espalda y cuando te ven ellos no dicen na'
Ando mi hermano DJ 
And tonight we gonna shake the block
Said, ""Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me ni aunque tú quieras"" (yeah)
That's a fact, Cardi B y de el trap soy la mamá
Hit the store y compro todo lo que quiera comprar
I'm a boss, you a worker, yo alante y tú atrás, ooh
Esta canción no es pa' mi curi y mi cuero, ooh
Un show mío lo que tú haces en un año entero
Si me ves no me saludes, tú y yo no somos amigas

He buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip
When I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front
I'm the hottest in the street
Know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth
Hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills

Their baby father want a feel

This shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter as gold
Tell that lil bitch play her role
I just a-rove in a Rolls
I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank
No, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know
That none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak
Only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's
Now it's a crib with a gate
Roly got charms, look like frosted flakes
I had to let these bitches know
Just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail

1047,Bronx Season,Cardi B,"Oh, how you doing?
I'm alright
Now how much times do I gotta prove these niggas wrong?
And how much times I gotta show these bitches I ain't soft?
How many shows I gotta sell out 'fore you get the cost?
Why they really tryna front like I ain't hit the charts?
All these labels, throwing deals from left to right
But I ain't giving in until they get them numbers right
All these people think that this shit happen overnight
All that flexin' they be doing
Shit is all a hype
No tolerance for a hating bitch
Talking shit
Only time I hold my tongue is when I'm sucking dick
So when I see you in the streets, yeah, it's fucking lit
And don't be talking all that sorry shit
Don't flip the script
I see the lights
I hear the hype
I hit the mic
I kill the show
I get my dough
I catch a flight
I see a hater
I'm running down
It's on sight
I throw my hands
I hit em' left
I hit em' right
They sleeping on me just because I used to strip
But it's all good cause now they wanna get up in my VIP
Blowing up my phone
Saying everything I touch is lit
Acting cool and wanna fuck me
Like they wasn't talking shit
I let em' live
Let the shady motherfuckers live
Get them the price then it's time to show em' what it is
Don't got the bat?
Well then what you really tryna pitch?
Don't waste my time
I ain't never been no average bitch
Not to mention
I did my tour and that shit was winning
Independent, the headline
Award of feeling
I thank the Lord for all the blessings that he is given
I love the fans
They fill me up with their ammunition
I don't really talk shit but now I gotta off this
I don't know why bitches think we work in the same office
Corny bitches tryna keep up?
Look exhausted
Wave the white flag
Girl, you might as well just forfeit
My ex told me I was never gon' be shit
Lookie, lookie now
Lookie now
Nigga I'm that bitch
What you thought?
Yeah, you really lost
Now you kinda sick
But I ain't never need a nigga
I was always on my shit
I used to stare at magazines
On the train
Looking at these models
Like ""I gotta be this one day""
Fuck around
Got myself a name
Now I'm getting paid
Left the corny bitches in the grave
Now they throwing shade"

Look, they gave a bitch two options: strippin' or lose
Used to dance in a club right across from my school
I said ""dance"" not ""fuck"", don't get it confused
Had to set the record straight 'cause bitches love to assume
Mama couldn't give it to me, had to get at Sue's
Lord only knows how I got in them shoes
I was covered in dollars, now I'm drippin' in jewels
A bitch play with my money? Might as well spit in my food
Bitches hated my guts, now they swear we was cool
Went from makin' tuna sandwiches to makin' the news
I started speakin' my mind and tripled my views
Real bitch, only thing fake is the boobs
Get money, go hard, you're mothafuckin' right
Never been no fraud in my mothafuckin' life
Get money, go hard, damn fuckin' right
Stunt on these bitches out of mothafuckin' spite
Ain't no runnin' up on me, went from nothin' to glory
I ain't tellin' ya to do it, I'm just tellin' my story
I don't hang with these bitches 'cause these bitches be corny
And I got enough bras, ya ain't gotta support me
I went from rag to riches, went from WIC to lit, nigga
Only person in my fam to see six figures
The pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders
When you gotta make sure that everybody straight
Bitches stab you in your back while they smilin' in your face
Talking crazy on your name, trying not to catch a case
I waited my whole life just to shit on niggas
Climbed to the top floor so I can spit on niggas
Said ""I was just tryna chill and make bangers"" (bangers)
Tell all these old bitches they in danger (stop)
The thing on my hip whip bitches into shape (brrrt)
That's what I call a fuckin' waist trainer
You gon' run up on who and do what? (who?)

So if it's all love, show me love then (huh?)
'Cause you hatin' on a bitch, that's what it sounds like
Beast mode, that's how I give it up, nigga
Hoodie low, that's how I'm pullin' up
Just 'cause I been on the road, don't mean I been on the run
And you gon' have to learn to hold your tongue or hold the gun (brrrt, woo)
And we all know you ain't that type (no)

Headshot, headshot, tell 'em closed case
Ain't no bitches spittin' like this since '08
I don't trust no nigga, I don't fear no bitch (fear no bitch)
Whole life been through some fucked up shit (fucked up)
They say I'm too that, oh, I'm too this
When you seen what I've seen, you end up like this (woo)
I walked into the label, ""where the check at?"" (where the check?)
Cardi B on the charts, ain't expect that
Where that bitch that was claimin' she a threat? (where?)
I'ma put a Louboutin where her neck at
They say, I'm too ratchet, they say, I act wild (I act wild, wild)

Beyoncé on my stereo, ""Resentment"" on repeat
I'ma make a bowl of cereal with a teaspoon of bleach
Serve it to you like, ""Here you go, nigga, bon appétit""
Look did you give it to her raw? You love her or nah?
You risk your whole home for a hoe from the bar?
You really want them hoes? You can have them bitches
You don't even cheat with no badder bitches

Whores in this house
There's some whores in this house
There's some whores in this house
There's some whores in this house (Hold up)
I said certified freak, seven days a week
Wet-ass pussy, make that pullout game weak (Ah)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fuckin' with some wet-ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy

Beat it up, nigga, catch a charge
Extra large and extra hard
Put this pussy right in your face
Swipe your nose like a credit card
Hop on top, I wanna ride
I do a kegel while it's inside
Spit in my mouth, look in my eyes
This pussy is wet, come take a dive
Tie me up like I'm surprised
Let's roleplay, I'll wear a disguise
I want you to park that big Mack truck right in this little garage
Make it cream, make me scream
Out in public, make a scene
I don't cook, I don't clean
But let me tell you, I got this ring (Ayy, ayy)

Gobble me, swallow me, drip down the side of me (Yuh)
Quick, jump out 'fore you let you get inside of me (Yuh)
I tell him where to put it, never tell him where I'm 'bout to be (Huh)
I run down on him 'fore I have a nigga runnin' me (Pow, pow, pow)
Talk your shit, bite your lip (Yuh)
Ask for a car while you ride that dick (While you ride that dick)
You really ain't never gotta fuck him for a thing (Yuh)
He already made his mind up 'fore he came (Ayy, ah)
Now get your boots and your coat for this wet-ass pussy (Ah, ah, ah)
He bought a phone just for pictures of this wet-ass pussy (Click, click, click)
Pay my tuition just to kiss me on this wet-ass pussy (Mwah, mwah, mwah)
Now make it rain if you wanna see some wet-ass pussy (Yuh, yuh)

Look, I need a hard hitter, need a deep stroker
Need a Henny drinker, need a weed smoker
Not a garter snake, I need a king cobra
With a hook in it, hope it lean over
He got some money, then that's where I'm headed
Pussy A1 just like his credit
He got a beard, well, I'm tryna wet it
I let him taste it, now he diabetic
I don't wanna spit, I wanna gulp
I wanna gag, I wanna choke
I want you to touch that lil' dangly thing that swing in the back of my throat
My head game is fire, punani Dasani
It's goin' in dry and it's comin' out soggy
I ride on that thing like the cops is behind me (Yuh, ah)
I spit on his mic and now he tryna sign me, woo

Your honor, I'm a freak bitch, handcuffs, leashes
Switch my wig, make him feel like he cheatin'
Put him on his knees, give him somethin' to believe in
Never lost a fight, but I'm lookin' for a beatin'
In the food chain, I'm the one that eat ya
If he ate my ass, he's a bottom-feeder
Big D stand for big demeanor
I could make ya bust before I ever meet ya
If it don't hang, then he can't bang
You can't hurt my feelings, but I like pain
If he fuck me and ask Whose is it?
When I ride the dick, I'ma spell my name, ah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fuckin' with some wet-ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy
Now from the top, make it drop, that's some wet-ass pussy
Now get a bucket and a mop, that's some wet-ass pussy
I'm talkin' wap, wap, wap, that's some wet-ass pussy
Macaroni in a pot, that's some wet-ass pussy, huh

There's some whores in this house
There's some whores in this house

Til his feet become bloody and tired
Her hologram photo stayed near to him
Buried deep in the pits of his heart
The lock of grey hair that she gave to him
Stayed clutched in his fist through the night
Dead or alive, she still yearned for him
Cause even in darkness there's light, oh and
One by one
It's your time
Lead them both back to one
The sun has come
May your light lead them both back to one
Indivisible sum
Here's the book now the saga's begun
He wonders if she is the one
(You're the one)
You're the one.
Cold in the cell lost and shivering
Gunshots in hallways unknown
On the fifth floor, past the blue door
Sat a chained 57821
Sir Greendown told his dear Cindi
Fight like Achilles in Troy
""I will show you the ways that I love you
I saved you so you'd save the world
Cause you're the only one""

Hold on, don't fight your war alone
Halo around you, don't have to face it on your own
We will win this fight, let all souls be brave
We'll find a way to heaven, we'll find a way

War is old, so is sex, let's play God, you go next
Hands go up, men go down, try my luck, stand my ground
Die in church, live in jail say her name, twice in hell
Uncle Sam kissed a man, Jim Crow Jesus rose again

I like my woman in the kitchen
I teach my children superstitions
I keep my two guns on my blue nightstand
A pretty young thang, she can wash my clothes
But she'll never ever wear my pants

I pledge allegiance to the flag
Learned the words from my mom and dad
Cross my heart and I hope to die
With a big old piece of American pie
Love me baby, love me for who I am
Fallen angels singing, ""Clap your hands""
Don't try to take my country, I will defend my land
I'm not crazy, baby, naw, I'm American
I'm American, I'm American, I'm American

Seventy-nine cent to your dollar
All that bullshit from white-collars
You see my color before my vision
Sometimes I wonder if you will fly
Would it help you make a better decision?

I pledge allegiance to the flag
Learned the words from my mom and dad
Cross my heart and I hope to die
With a big old piece of American pie
Just love me baby, love me for who I am
Fallen angels singing, ""Clap your hands""
Don't try to take my country, I will defend my land
I'm not crazy, baby, naw, I'm American
I'm American, I'm American, I'm American

Let me help you in here
Until women can get equal pay for equal work
This is not my America
Until same-gender loving people can be who they are
This is not my America
Until black people can come home from a police stop without being shot in the head
This is not my America
Until poor whites can get a shot at being successful
This is not my America
I can't hear nobody talkin' to me

Just love me baby, love me for who I am
Fallen angels singing, ""Clap your hands""
Don't try to take my country, I will defend my land
I'm not crazy, baby, naw
I'm American (love me baby)
I'm American (love me for who I am)

Until Latinos and Latinas don't have to run from walls
This is not my America
But I tell you today that the devil is a liar
Because it's gon' be my America before it's all over

1084,Babopbyeya,Janelle Monae,"
The only love my heart approaches
Your tender eyes fill mind with roses
I drink your wine
And never will my heart dry inside
Or be denied
Walking like a lonely fool in Prague
Singing a love song and the words I wrote
I wrote for two
Gentle as a lullaby at night
I hear you humming private melodies
You're near
BaBopByeYa.
Where are you my darling?
BaBopByeYa.
Can you hear me calling?
Rewind the clock, our time's approaching
Give us the eyes to guide us most when
We have no light to see throughout all our darkest days
And troubled ways

Ojos miran hacia la luna
Evitan un mundo tan triste
Dominado bajo el odio
Donde el amor no existe
Dame en su reino refugio
De la oscuridad peligrosa
Espero en la esquina, Querida
Busco la llamanda amorosa
Eyes look to the moon
Avoid a world so sad
Ruled under the hate
Where there is love
Give me refuge in his kingdom
In the dark dangerous
I hope in the corner, Dear
Seeking the love Call us
Like a lonely matador at night
Fighting in the darkness for the light
I won't stop until I hear the call of love...
And when I'm alone, you are near to me
You have made a home in my memory
There you will abide for forever
And I will keep you warm in the night

In the face of an awful danger
he risks his life to save her
Lowly manger
Arms of strangers
To me
Allude me
Pursue me
Truly
I heed echos of your laughter in the corners of my mind
While I memorise each detail of your intricate design
In your hair there is a symphony
Your lips, a string quartet
They tell stories of a Neon Valley Street
Where we first met
now somewhere time pursues us
As we love in Technicolor
But I dwell in silence on your words
Which move me like none other
This time I shall be unafraid
And violence will not move me
this time we will relax
This time we will stay in our movie
I see beyond tomorrow
This life of strife and sorrow
My freedom calls and I must go"

And a place to belong
I find it hard to fit in
I meet lots of pretty girls
In this fantasy world
Waiting for their turn to shine
So I try to be Cindi, in hopes that they'd notice
But I wasn't their cup of tea
Its so lonely, when I'm only being me
Who's that girl in the mirror
With hair like a rock star
She wants to dance but she has cold feet
Her confidence is low
So much talent but who'll know
When she's afraid to follow her dreams
So I talk to her heart and made up her mind
That I gotta except her for me
But its so lonely, when I'm only being me
Ooooooohhh
You gotta be you and I've gotta be me
Only, only be me"

Who would end my childish games for good

Box office numbers, and they doin' outstanding
Running outta space in my damn bandwagon
Remember when they used to say I look too mannish
Black girl magic, y'all can't stand it
Y'all can't ban it, made out like a bandit
They been trying hard just to make us all vanish
I suggest they put a flag on a whole nother planet
Jane Bond, never Jane Doe
And I Django, never Sambo
Black and White, Yeah that's always been my camo
It's looking like y'all gon' need some more ammo
I cut em off, I cut em off, I cut em off like Van Gogh
Now, damn right for the angle
I got away with murder, no Scandal
Cue the violins and the Viola's
We gave you life, we gave you birth
We gave you God, we gave you Earth
Within the future, don't make it worse
You want the world? Well, what's it worth?
Emoticons, Decepticons, and Autobots
Who twist the plot?
Who shot the sheriff, then fled to Paris
In the darkest hour, spoke truth to power?
Made a fandroid outta yo girlfriend
Let's get caught downtown in a whirlwind
And paint the city pink, paint the city pink
And tuck the pearls in, just in case the world end
And nigga, down dawg
Nigga move back, take a seat, you were not involved
And hit the mute button
Let the vagina have a monologue
Mansplaining, I fold em like origami
What's a wave, baby? This a tsunami
For the culture, I kamikaze
I put my life on a life line
If she the G.O.A.T. now, would anybody doubt it?
If she the G.O.A.T. now, would anybody doubt it?
Do anybody got it? Do anybody got it?
I say anybody got it?"
1095,Dont Judge Me,Janelle Monae,"
Come, let me kiss you right there
Wake you up like sunrise, on the backs of your thighs
I'm gonna pray you this prayer
That I keep in my mind, as a lovely reminder

Even though you tell me you love me
I'm afraid that you just love my disguise
Taste my fears and light your candle to my raging fire
Of broken desire

But don't judge me
I know I got issues but they drown when I kiss you
Don't judge me
Baptize me with ocean, recognize my devotion

The water's perfectly good
Let's reintroduce ourselves, from a free point of view
If I'm gon' sin, it's with you
Tattoo your love on my heart, let the rumors be true

Even though you tell me you love me
I'm afraid that you just love my disguise
Taste my fears and light your candle to my raging fire
The dirty desire

But don't judge me
I know I got issues but they drown when I kiss you
Don't, don't judge me
Baptize me with ocean, recognize my devotion

What if I, what if I touched you right there?

Even though you say that you love me
Is it me or do you love my disguise?
If I missed you, would you think I was lonely
If I say what's on my mind?
Even though you say that you love me
Is it me or do you love my disguise?
If I kissed you, would you think I was lonely
If I let you inside?

Come, let me kiss you right there
But if I kissed you right there
Would you tremble inside, or just call it a night?
What if I gave you a show? You could touch if you like
Right there
If I kissed you would you think I was lonely?
If I

It feels so good
Come, let me kiss you right there
Just say that you love me"
1096,Dorothy Dandridge Eyes,Janelle Monae,"Looking out the corner of her eye
As she sits alone and drinks her wine
Every man just wants to pass her by
In hopes that he can catch her eye
That glow that's in her eye
Gives you visions in your mind
She's from another space and time
That's when you'll know you're hypnotized
Her intoxicating will not be denied
And when you touch her glove
She then becomes your drug
You fall so deep in love with the girl

It's too late you're hypnotized
She's got Dorothy Dandridge eyes
And you love her, you love her, you love her, you love that girl
It's too late you're hypnotized
She's got Dorothy Dandridge eyes
And you love her, you love that girl
Like a rare Picasso or Monet
The kind of beauty studied every day
Every woman wants her grace and style
But no one can replicate her smile
That glow that's in her eyes
Gives you visions in your mind
She's from another space and time
That's when you'll know you're hypnotized
And her intoxicating will not be denied
And when you touch her glove
She then becomes your drug
You fall so deep in love with the girl

It's too late you're hypnotized
She's got Dorothy Dandridge eyes
And you love her, you love her, you love her, you love that girl
It's too late you're hypnotized
She's got Dorothy Dandridge eyes
And you love her, you love that girl

In your eyes we see the tiny white snowcaps of mountains
The purple glow of distant stars
The blue shine of black metal
Red rose petals falling slowly through the sunny air"

1099,Faster,Janelle Monae,"You, since that magic day
We've been like magnets in a play
We smash in then pull away
Every day
You, you're a jet, a flying gun
You kill me softly with your sun
You melt my wings and call it fun
I should run
Faster and faster
I should run
Faster and faster
From your arms
I watch my powers die
Falling out of starry skies
You kryptonite my life
Every night
The ending of this road
Dashing prince or horny toad?
Who really ever knows?
I should know
Faster and faster
I should run
Faster and faster
From your arms
Mmm, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm running
shaking like a schizo
'Lectric sheep are dancing in the window
My heart beats
It's kicking like a kick drum
Am I a freak?
Or just another weirdo
Call me weak
Or just call me your hero
You can't zap down all my good times
I know right from wrong
Kissing loving's feeling good
And not this feeling down
You hide your chainsaw deep in kisses
That don't make it quiet
You got em running, muttering, screaming, each and every night
Faster and faster
I should run
Faster and faster
From your arms"
1100,Ghetto Woman,Janelle Monae,"VERSE 1:
Carry on Ghetto Woman
I see you working night to morning light yet no one cares
Carry on Ghetto Woman
Cause even though they laugh and talk about the clothes
You wear
I wish they could just realize
That all you've ever needed was someone to free your
Mind
Carry on Ghetto Woman
Cause even in your darkest hours I still see your light
And when you cry don't you know that I am crying with
You?
When people put you down, yeah way down and you feel
Like you're alone
Let love be your guide
You were built to last through any weather
Oh Ghetto Woman hold on to your dreams
And all your great philosophies
You're the reason I believe in me, for real
VERSE 2:
Carry on Ghetto Woman
When you doubt if you're a star, just know we still believe
Carry on Ghetto Woman
Even when the news portrays you less than you could be
I wish they could just realize
All you ever needed was someone to free your mind
Carry on Ghetto Woman
You're the 7th wonder reigning over us at night
When you cry, don't you know we're right there crying with
You
People put you down, yeah way down and you feel like
You're alone
Let love be your guide
You were built to last through any weather
Oh Ghetto Woman hold on to your dreams and all your
Great philosophies
You're the reason I believe in me, for real
Some say this ghetto land will take you down and poison
You
Some say she can do all the things a man can do
Who said the ghetto's just a place where queens dance
Naked on the moon?
We say a woman came to change the face of each and every room
VERSE 3 (RAP):
When I was just a baby my momma dropped out of school
It was only second semester the baby due
The doctor said ""December the first your due date""
The daddy he was gone off to college he couldn't wait
Only just a teen with dreams to be on TV
And living with a mom and my grandma who used to feed
We would move around in the city place to place
The landlord come for the rent face to face
Her eyes too heavy from working nights as a janitor
She'd keep it to herself and nobody could understand her
Even when she thought that she couldn't she carried on
She couldn't imagine both of her daughters here all alone
Before the tuxedos and black and white every day
Used to watch my momma get down on her knees and
Pray
She's the reason that I'm even writing this song
Ghetto Woman no it won't be long. Now sing along
Let it use you
Let it use you
When the love is strong
It won't let you be alone
Let it use you
Just let the spirit lead you"
1101,Givin Em What They Love,Janelle Monae,"
I am sharper than a razor
Eyes made of lasers
Bolder than the truth
They want me locked up in the system
'Cuz I'm on a mission
Blame it on my youth
Too long I've been out here on my own
Now I'm bout to bring it home
Like a rolling stone
I ain't never been afraid to die
Look a man in the eye

I come to give you what you love...
It's time to give you what you love...
I'mma give you what you love...
Givin' you what you love...

I am sharper than a switchblade
First and last of what God made and that's the truth
But man, keep on tryna' hold me back
While another chicken head come home to roost
Too strong, tryna do me wrong
And the last one standing will order to my dance
Ohho...dance!

Run tell your preacher and your teacher

(2x)
I say to take your time!
Take what you love
Baby, just enough
But never too much
Take your time!

Would you give me what you love!


Two dimes walked up in the building
Tall and concealing, wearing fancy things
Chopped up with a knife, hammered like a screw.
When they walked in the room we didn't know what to do
One looked at me and I looked back
She said, ""Can you tell me where the party's at?""
She followed me back to the lobby
Yeah, she was looking at me for some undercover love"

1110,I Like That,Janelle Monae,"
Sometimes a mystery, sometimes I'm free
But they don't know my mood or my attitude
Sometimes I wanna roll or stay at home
Walking contradiction, guess I'm factual and fiction

A little crazy, little sexy, little cool
Little rough around the edges but I keep it smooth
I'm always left of center and that's right where I belong
I'm the random minor note you hear in major songs

And I like that
I don't really give a fuck if I was just the only one
Who likes that
I never like to follow, follow all the 

Oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
Oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
Oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
I like that

Better than amazing, and better than I could

Little rough around the edges but I keep it smooth
I'm always left of center and that's right where I belong
I'm the random minor note you hear in major songs

I remember when you called me weird
We was in math class third row I was sitting by you
Right before Mr. Ammond's class
Cause my mom couldn't afford new J's
Polos, thrift store, thrift clothes that was all I knew
Do you remember?
Uh, I remember when you laughed when I cut my perm off
And you rated me a six
I was like, ""Damn""
But even back then with the tears in my eyes
I always knew I was the shit

I like that

1112,I Want You Back,Janelle Monae,"When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you
Stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me
To take second look
Oh baby give me one more chance
To show you that I love you
Won't you please send me back in your heart
Oh darlin' I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms
I want you back
Yes I do now
I want you back
Ooh ooh baby
Yeah yeah, naw
Trying to live without your love
Is one long sleepless night
Let me show you girl
That I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on
I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl
I didn't even want around
Oh baby give me one more chance
To show you that I love you
Won't you please send me back in your heart

All I want!
Abuh buh buh buh
All I need!

1113,Its Code,Janelle Monae,"Love is knowing all my mind
Feeling real dumb, all dressed up in my new suit
Took my name, my site, my song
Been trying to find myself all day long
I heard them saying that love will be a curse or a listless fringe
Love belongs in movies
Now I know I'll plaque with your heart
Cause when I turn back around I saw
You in someone else's arms
Walking around town, all dressed up making your move
But I was scared to fall in love
I never thought I'd be the one, to push you in the arms, oh!
Oh baby, it's code
I want you to hold me, and love me until I won't no more
And need me, and need me until I need no more
Baby, it's code
Baby, it's code
(Oh baby)
Oh baby, hey baby!
I want to be in your arms, ohh!
Please don't leave...
Please! I need a nurse
I've been... hurt!
I need a glass of Merlot Black
I know I was wrong, but can't you see the harm that have been done to me
Oh!"

1118,Locked Inside,Janelle Monae,"I'm locked inside
A land called foolish pride
Where the man is always right
He hates to talk but loves to fight
Is that all right?
On real cold days
He loans us lots of hate
But he says that we must pay
To take it all away
Is that okay?
But I'm asking you will you stay with me
In this land where we are free
And I know it's rough
And you've had enough
But one day we'll be happy
And when I look into the future I see danger in its eyes
Hearts of hatred rule the land while love is left aside
Killing plagues the citizens while music slowly dies
I get frightened, I - see, I get frightened, I...
Oh how, oh how I need you baby
To keep me from going crazy
I really need you baby
Need you to stay
Oh how, oh how I love you baby
These people are so crazy
I really need you baby
Need you to stay
She's quick to fight
For her man but not her rights
Even though it's 3005
When will we end this genocide?
And that's not right
Her children cry
No food to eat and her friends as flies
The color black means it's time to die
And nobody questions why
Cause they're too scared to stop the man
But I'm asking you will you stay with me
In this land where we are free
And I know it's rough
And you've had enough
But one day we'll be happy
'Cause when I look into the future I see danger in its eyes
Babies die before they're born and no one ever smiles
The writers and the artists all are paid to tell us lies
They keep us locked inside; they keep us locked inside...
Oh how, oh how I need you baby
To keep me from going crazy
I really need you baby
Need you to stay
Oh how, oh how I love you baby
These people are so crazy
I really need you baby
Need you to stay
I can make a change
I can start a fire
Lord make me love again
Fill me with desire
I can make a change
I can start a fire
Make me love again
Lord thank You for desire
And when I look into your pretty eyes I almost want to cry
I think about my life and I don't want to live a lie
How I need you baby, I need you right by my side
I need you tonight, I need you tonight
Yeah! How I need you baby
See i can't let you go, I need you
On the other side
On the other side
I love you so and I'll never let you go
On the other side!"
1119,Look Into My Eyes,Janelle Monae,"Look into my eyes, let them hypnotize
These eyes long to make you a perfect work of art
Fall in love with me only then you'll see
What these eyes have been planning for you
You lift my heart when I fly, good morning, good night
It's a brave new world calling, a lover's fantasy
Look into my eyes, fall in love with me
And we'll both watch the sun kiss the sea
Fall in love with he, cross the golden sand
There's a road winding up into sun rays
There's a staircase winding down
Think of all the heavens that you've found
May our love be so bright and so true
May our love be so brave and so true."
1120,Make Me Feel,Janelle Monae,"
Baby, don't make me spell it out for you
All of the feelings that I've got for you
Can't be explained, but I can try for you
Yeah, baby, don't make me spell it out for you
You keep on asking me the same questions (why?)
And second guessing all my intentions
Should know by the way I use my compression
You've got the answers to my confessions

It's like I'm powerful with a little bit of tender
An emotional, sexual bender
Mess me up, yeah, but no one does it better
There's nothing better

That's just the way you make me feel
That's just the way you make me feel
So good, so good, so fucking real
That's just the way you make me feel
That's just the way you make me feel

You know I love it, so please don't stop it
You got me right here in your jean pocket (Right here)
Laying your body on a shag carpet (Oh)
You know I love it so please don't stop it

An emotional, sexual bender
Mess me up, yeah, but no one does it better

So good, so good, so fucking real
That's just the way you make me feel
That's just the way you make me feel

That's just the way that I feel now, baby
Good God! I can't help it! Agh!
That's just the way that I feel
Please! I can't help it

It's like I'm powerful with a little bit of tender
An emotional, sexual bender
Mess me up, yeah, but no one does it better
There's nothing better

I'm happy to announce that we have a star cross winner
in today's heartbreak sweepstakes.
Android No. 57821 otherwise known as Cyndi Mayweather
has fallen desperately in love with a human named Anthony Greendown!
And you know the rules?
She is now scheduled for immediate dis-assembly!
Bounty hunters you can find her in the Neon Valley
Street District on the fourth floor at the Leopard Plaza apartment complex.
The Droid Control Marshall's are full of fun rules today.
No faizers only chainsaws and electro-daggers!
Remember only card carrying hunters can join our chase today.
And as usual there will be no reward until her cyber-soul
is turned into the Star Commission.
Happy hunting's!"
1123,Metropolis,Janelle Monae,"View a sky without any blue.
Breakfast on incandescent, built to chew.
Dream to find another world
Where a cyborg can love and a cyber girl is still a queen.

Where there's no law,
Tying my heart from the start.
Where there's no war, if my dreams run a little wild,
But if there's no call from joy control
Warning me against this disease in my heart.
Freein' my soul.
Population 10 zillion and six
Where signs say, ""Welcome to the Star Core Metropolis.""
Me, I live on the wired side of town,
Reaching and searching for a space called paradise found.

Where there's no law
Tying my heart from the start.
Where there's no war, if my dreams run a little wild,
But if there's no call from joy control
Warning me against this disease in my heart.
Freein' my soul.
And it's a common thought
that wired folk can be sold and bought.
That we have no feelings no memories or minds,
That we're bionic strumpets only worth a dime.
To some it's a surprise when I smile.
And when I hold your hand, they say,
""How can a wired thing understand?
Love is too deep; it's too wide to feel
when your soul is a button
and your foot glows in heels.""
Program. Program. Reprogram.
One nation, under a microchip.
Neon slaves, electric savages,
open your hearts. Open your eyes. Your chariot will arrive.
Hey, Anthony Greendown from sector nine. (From sector nine)
With beautiful eyes
I've served you now about thirty-eight times.
Thirty-eight times I've looked in those eyes.
You see me laughing, the love when I hold your hand,
I wanna take you, take you with me to another land.

Where there's no law
Tying my heart from the start.
Where there's no war, if my dreams run a little wild,
But if there's no call from joy control.
No call.
Please go with me.
Oh come with me.
I need you.

Tomorrow I'm paying my rent
My Fuel is runnin' low

A book is worth more than a bomb any day
And remember a mirror to Africa
Who will bring the cure before it's too late.
Don't you see the hurt in their eyes?
So much disappointment in many faces
Use your heart and not your pride
We can't go on and keep pretending
Please Mr. President
Where's all the money you spent,
Food is fallin low
And they have nowhere to go,
Quit slowin me down.
I ask you to have mercy on us father,
You think we know the rules by now,
We can't go starting wars with hearts of hatred
Out nations greed won't make it better
Or quiet the fears in our hearts
Don't you see the hurt in their eyes?
So much Disappointment in all of their faces
Use your heart and not your pride
We can't go on and keep pretending
O please Mr. President
Dear Mr. President
I hope you got the letter I sent
A Dollar only goes so far
And we need help here, no matter who we are
See we come from different worlds and different places
Until there's one great land, one nation under god,

How selfish, when he'd give his life for mine
He even tried to make a new start
Around the time I said we needed time apart
I knew that sticks and stones would break your bones
But I didn't know my words would break your heart
I can't believe love just passed me by
I can't believe I just looked love right in the eyes
I can't believe love just passed me by
I can't believe love just passed me by
See I've been hurt too many times before
I thought that you were going to hurt me too
Love lifts me up then brings me down, down, down
I really wish you were around (and now you're gone)
I never gave you what was due you
I ended up just doing me
I wanted to apologize to you
But now it's too late
Because you're six feet under me
I met a boy one day
Messed up and broke his heart
He won't come back to me
He's so far gone, you see
I can't believe love just passed me by
I can't believe I just looked love right in the eyes
I can't believe love just passed me by
I can't believe love just passed me by
See I've been hurt too many times before
I thought that you were going to hurt me too
Your love lifts me up and then it brings me down

1128,Neon Valley Street,Janelle Monae,"May this song reach your heart
May your ears love the sweet melody
Every note, every chord
I've arranged them for you and for me
May the sound of my voice be your guide
Bring you closer to me
Let us bathe in the noise
Let the love in your heart speak to me
For now, I'll pretend
I'm holding your hand
May this song reach your heart
May this song reach your heart
May this song reach your heart
May this song journey on to you
We met alone forbidden in the city
Running fast through time like Tubman and John Henry
But the time was wrong
Illegal aliens moaned
It's such a pity that the city's just a danger zone
Atomic blues bombing hearts like Iraqis in Babylon
The droid control will take your soul and rate it
Berate, slay it
You hate it and debate it but you don't get caught
And outlaw outrunning the law, ha
May the strings make you smile
May they always remind you of me
For now let's pretend
I'm holding your hand
May this song reach your heart
May this song reach your heart
May this song reach your heart
May this song journey on for you"
1129,Oh Maker,Janelle Monae,"I hear the drizzle of the rain
It's falling from my window
And in the corners of my mind
I hope that I'll get to see you again
La da die da die da die da die my friend
I heard the colors in the flowers
Just like the candle snugged at dawn
You're here, you're near, you're there and then you're gone
La da die da die da die da die
Suffering in sinking sand
All the hurt
See I'm really lost baby
We suffered a rare, rare blue
So much hurt
On this earth
But you loved me
And I really dared to love you too
Perhaps what I mean to say is
Is that it's amazing that your love was mine
Oh, Maker tell me did you know
This love would burn so yellow
Becoming orange and in its time
Explode from grey to black then bloody wine
La da die da die da die da die
Oh, Maker have you ever loved?
Or known just what it was?
I can't imagine the bitter end
Of all the beauty that we're living in?
Suffering in sinking sand
All the hurt
See I'm really lost baby
We suffered a rare, rare blue
So much hurt
On this earth
But you loved me
And I really dared to love you too
Perhaps what I mean to say is
Is that it's amazing that your love was mine"

Jump in the shower.
Grab my towel and put my V. secrets on.
(I'm getting ready)
And brush my teeth cuz I'm almost ready to roll.

I know I should focus on my school work.
I shouldn't feel the way I do, but I do.
My friends all said that he would be there.
And plus I look real cute.
(I'm getting ready)
I heard the clubs in Atlanta are the sickest... the sickest.
(I'm getting ready)
And now it's time for me to pay a visit... a visit.
I know I won't wake up in time for Sunday
To be in Sunday school... in Sunday school.
I really hope this boy is cool.

It's time I fought for love.
I know he'll be there waiting.
Four hundred girls in the room
And I am all he sees.
Enough debating.
I'm sick and tired of waiting.
I grab my petticoat and my ID.
My friends are waiting
Eagerly anticipating.
Gotta get there before midnight cuz it's free.
My heart starts beating fast as we pull closer.
No turning back girl now you've gotta know.
No turning back right now I've gotta know.
(Know, oh, oh)
Well, girl there he is
There's your boy
Can't you see
I bet he's looking around tryna find you
I can't believe I'm here tonight
But wrong or right
I refuse to act scared and ignore you
My heart starts beating fast as you walk over

You got me feeling tipsy but I'm sober

Girl, naw, I had one of the craziest dreams.
I know he's gonna be there. (I know I should focus on my school work)
Scandalous? Girl I am not scandalous. (I shouldn't feel the way I do, but I do)
I have a test Tuesday and I cannot miss church tomorrow.
(My friends all said that he would be there.)
No, I told everybody I was coming and I'm gon' be there. (And plus I look real cute)
Listen. Girl, bye. I love you. I will talk to you later. (I know I won't wake up in time for Sunday)

1132,Peachtree Blues,Janelle Monae,"Good morning twilight.
Not a star in the sky.
Lost without my baby
And I just don't know why.
A lonely night on Peachtree
Clubs are closed (it's only three)
Dreary weather on my mind
I think it's raining all the time.
Visions of you in havana
'round my head like dragonfly.
(sigh) it makes my heart sigh.
Since my baby left me
All I can do is cry.
Lonely night on Peachtree.
Clubs are closed; it's only three.
Dreary weather on my mind
I think it's raining all the time.
Looking for a love in a weary rain
My heart's broken
And-I-can't-stand'
Can't stand loving you
You not loving me.
Lonely night on Peachtree.
Clubs are closed; it's only three.
Feels like I'm paying love dues.
I've got the Peachtree blues.
I've got the Peachtree blues"

I can't wait 'til we get to rock
I wanna scream and dream and throw a love parade
Is that okay?
Tonight it's me and you alone
Won't make a call, won't even write a song
See I've been waiting and waiting for the time to say
Now listen baby
When you're down, and it's hard
And you feel like you've given your all
Baby our love will always keep it real and true
Cause baby it's a primetime for our love
Ain't nobody peekin' but the stars above
It's a primetime for our love
And heaven is bettin' on us
Bang bang, I'm calling your name
You're like a fire the world can't tame
I wanna riot 'til the stars come out and play
Is that okay? (Okay)
Tonight it's me and you alone
Won't take a call, won't even write a song
This'll be a personal holiday
Listen baby
When you're down, and it's hard
And you feel like you've given your all
Baby my love is always right here for you
Yeah
Cause baby it's a primetime for our love
Ain't nobody peekin' but the stars above
It's a primetime for our love
And heaven is bettin' on us
It's a primetime for our love (yes it is)
Ain't nobody peekin' but the stars above
It's a primetime for our love

Pink when you're blushing inside, baby
Pink is the truth you can't hide, maybe
Pink like the folds of your brain, crazy
Pink as we all go insane

So, here we are in the car
Leaving traces of us down the boulevard
I wanna fall through the stars
Getting lost in the dark is my favourite part
Let's count the ways we could make this last forever
Sunny, money, keep it funky
Touch your top and let it down

Ah, yeah
Some like that

Pink where it's deepest inside, crazy

Pink like the secrets you hide, maybe
Pink like the lid of your eye, baby
Pink is where all of it starts, crazy
Pink like the holes of your heart

And am I weird to dance alone late at night?
And is it true we're all insane?
And I just tell 'em, ""No we ain't"" and get down
I heard this life is just a play with no rehearsal
I wonder will this be my final act tonight
And tell me what's the price of fame?
Am I a sinner with my skirt on the ground?
Am I a freak for dancing around?
Am I a freak for getting down?
I'm coming up, don't cut me down
Yeah I wanna be
Hey brother can you save my soul from the devil?
Say is it weird to like the way she wear her tights?
And is it rude to wear my shades?
Am I a freak because I love watching Mary? (Maybe)

But when it's time pay they turn around and call us needy.

Gimme back my pyramid, I'm trying to free Kansas City.

You can take my wings but I'm still goin' fly
And even when you edit me the booty don't lie
Yeah, keep singing and I'mma keep writing songs
I'm tired of Marvin asking me, ""What's Going On?
March to the streets 'cuz I'm willing and I'm able

Wake up, Mary
Have you heard the news?
You got to wake up, Mary
You've got the right to choose
I tried and heard the pride
But the way the stars look into my eyes tonight
Tell me who can, who can I trust?
To get lost in your thoughts
Is a very very complex knot
And the things that you find are surprising
It's the way you believe
That becomes the very thing you see
Take a ride in the sky
It's just calling
But all your friends are gone
And the dreams will burn while the comets play on
Tell me who can, who can I trust?
I wanna fly
Fly
Honey
To you, to the stars
Ooh
Ride, ride, ride
Sally won't you
I know you love me but I'm still gone
I got to make my peace
I got to move on

Oh, just wake up, Mary
You got the right to choose
Just wake up, Mary,
There's some amazing news
Just wake up, Mary

A rarely painted masterpiece
A place few people go or ever know
An underwater rocket love

Say you'll go to Nirvana
Will you leave Samsara?
In the words of Dhammapada
""Who will lead? Who will follow?""
Our love will sail in this ark
The world could end outside our window
Let's find forever
And write our name in fire on each others' hearts
Love is not a fantasy
A haiku written in Japanese
A word too often used but not believed
Witness the interaction of
The flood, the sea, the sky, the dove
Time erodes the shore but not our love
Say you'll go to Nirvana
Will you leave Samsara?
Or in the words of Dhammapada
""Who will lead? Who will follow?""

The world could end outside our window

1142,Sincerely Jane,Janelle Monae,"Left the city, my momma she said, ""Don't come back home
These kids 'round killin each other, they lost they minds, they gone
They quittin' school, making babies and can barely read
Some gone off to that war, Lord have mercy on them
One, two, three, four, your cousins is 'round here sellin' dope
While they're daddy, your uncle, is walking 'round strung out
Babies with babies, and their tears keep burning
While their dreams go down the drain now""
(While their dreams go down the drain)
Are we really living or just walking dead now?
(Are we walking dead now?)
Or dreaming of a hope riding the wings of angels?
The way we live, the way we die
What a tragedy, I'm so terrified
Day dreamers, please wake up
We can't sleep no more
Love don't make no sense, ask your neighbor
The winds have changed, it seems that they've abandoned us
The truth hurts, and so does yesterday
What good is love if it burns bright and explodes in flames?
I thought every living thing had love, but uh...
Are we really living or just walking dead now?
(Are we walking dead now?)
Or dreaming of a hope riding the wings of angels?
The way we live, the way we die
What a tragedy, I'm so terrified
Day dreamers, please wake up
We can't sleep no more
I've seen them shootin' up funerals in they Sunday clothes (Yah)
And spending money on spinners but won't pay college loans (Yah)
And all you gangers and bangers rolling dice and taking lives in a smokey dark
Lord have mercy on you (Yah)
Teacher, teacher please reach those girls in them videos (Live your life)
The little girls just broken Queens, confusing bling for soul
Danger, there's danger, when you take off your clothes
All your dreams go down the drain, girl
Are we really living or just walking dead now?
Or dreaming of a hope riding the wings of angels?
The way we live (The way we live)
The way we die (The way we die)
What a tragedy, I'm so terrified
Day dreamers, please wake up
We can't sleep no more

(Lord, have mercy on them)
(Lord, have mercy on them)
(Lord, have mercy on them)
(Are we really living or just walking dead now?)
We live and then we die, and we never know the why
So now, now we go, down underground
We think that we can fly, but we never touch the sky
So now, now we go, down underground
(Ooh)
57821, it is now time for you to come home, my dear
You've been gone long enough
Thank you

But you must come, you must go...

1144,So Afraid,Janelle Monae,"
All the kids run around playing free and fun, while the dogs lap around the can
Falling down, climbing trees, swimming in the river, no life jacket on their backs
Daughters sharpen their knives and they hunt for food, others watch their children grow
Mothers going to work and they shake the hands of a corporate tycoon's ghost

And I'm afraid
Ah, I'm so afraid
Ah, what if I lose?
Is what I think to myself
I'm fine in my shell
I'm afraid of it all, afraid of loving you

I'm a gift and a curse to the wilderness when the leaves only turn to brown
The birds fly high and they wink at all of the grandmothers on the ground
Rain pours down in the village dens, my cousins fetch for lunch
While I sit in my room writing letters to my church and things and such

'Cause I'm afraid
Ah, I'm so afraid
Ah, what if I lose?
Is what I think to myself
I'm fine in my shell
I'm afraid of it all, afraid of loving you

Cousins all in the creek

And the rain pours down, the ghetto dancin', yeah

I'm so afraid
Ah, I'm so afraid
Ah, what if I lose?

You can be a star
A star
YouâE™ve got the greatest gift in the world
Just believe and you can do it girl
As a little girl
There was so many things I wanted to be
The big stage the attention of the crowd
Had always inspired me
So every night when I knelled down to pray
IâE™d ask the lord to make me a star one day
Then a voice said
You can be a star x3
You can be a star
A star
YouâE™ve got the greatest gift in the world
Just believe and you can do it oh girl
As time went on
I let doubt get the best of me
Saying you just a country girl
And being a star is only in your dreams
That night my mother set me down to say
Have faith the world will know who you are one day
She told me
You can be a star x3
You can be a star
A star
YouâE™ve got the greatest gift in the world
Just believe and you can do it girl

Is it worth it?
I donâE™t know
That life isnâE™t perfect
Ooh I donâE™t know
Things will get worse if
You become a star
WonâE™t somebody help me out right now?
Is it worth it?
Tell me
That life isnâE™t perfect
Left me know
Things will get worse if
You become a star
Ooh if I become a star
So many broken promises
In writing to the top
Expectations of who I should be
Changed how I see this industry
So I learned
Follow my heart and go with my soul
Stay true to me and never lose sight of my goals
You can be a star x3
You can be a star
A star
YouâE™ve got the greatest gift in the world
Just believe and you can do it girl
You can be a star x3
Oh you can be a star
A star

Just believe have faith you can do it ooh girl"

Even when you're upset, these words of love
'Cause God is love
Allah is love
Jehovah is love
So, don't let your expressions, even of anger
Be confused or misconstrued
Turn them into words of expression
That can be understood by using words of love"

And your MacBook
Clothes shows will shut you down
Before we go-go backwards
Act up, and whether we high or low
We gonna get back up
Like the Dow Jones and NASDAQ
Sorta like a thong in a ass crack,
Come on
I tip on alligators and little rattle snakers
But I'm another flavor
Something like a terminator
Ain't no equivocating
I fight for what I believe
Why you talkin' bout it
S-s-she's talkin' bout it
Some callin' me a sinner
Some callin' me a winner
I'm callin' you to dinner

The way you clapped your hands
And I remember the smell of guns
War lived in me but love finally won
I've been delayed I've been denied
And then you came around and took the crown
We were unbreakable
We were like Rock n' Roll
We were like a king and queen
I want you to know
No matter how the story's told
We were like rock n' roll
We were like a king and queen
I want you to know
I remember our time alone
Wanting to dance locked in your arms
Your melody stays haunting me
We were twenty one and thought we owned the sun
And I remember our plan to run
My rebel ways and your utter nonsense
We'd go insane but it felt so fun
And now your queen is home to take your throne
We were unbreakable
We were like Rock n' Roll
We were like a king and queen

When Jamaica got way too cold (and your kisses warmed the sand)
And every time I think of you (I wanna be your rock n' roll)

Off in Paris, France (we taught poets how to dance)
Back to Tokyo (remember saki in Japan)
When Jamaica got way too cold (and your kisses warmed the sand)
And every time I think of you (I wanna be your rock n' roll)
So What are you gonna do? (so what are you gonna do?)
Cause I remember you (because I remember you)
Keep marching on we will love when the time is right
Keep marching on we will love when the time is right"

1162,Wondaland,Janelle Monae,"Early late at night
I wander off into a land
You can go, but you mustn't tell a soul
There's a world inside
Where dreamers meet each other
Once you go it's hard to come back
Let me paint your canvas as you dance
Dance in the trees
Paint mysteries
The magnificent droid plays there
Your magic mind
Makes love to mine
I think I'm in love, angel
Take me back to Wondaland
I gotta get back to Wondaland
Take me back to Wondaland
I think me left me underpants
The grass grows inside
The music floats you gently on your toes
Touch the nose, he'll change your clothes to tuxedos
Don't freak and hide
I'll be your secret santa, do you mind?
Don't resist
The fairygods will have a fit
We should dance
Dance in the trees
Paint mysteries
The magnificent droid plays there
Your magic mind
Makes love to mine
I think I'm in love, angel
Take me back to Wondaland
I gotta get back to Wondaland
Take me back to Wondaland
I think me left me underpants
This is your land
This is my land
We belong here
Stay the night
I am so inspired
You touched my wires
My supernova shining bright
Take me back to Wondaland
I gotta get back to Wondaland
Take me back to Wondaland

And I'm gonna do whatever feels right for me

how i feel inside
with a heart so small
dont feel sorry for me
dont you feel guilty
since you moved on
internally he murdered me
my emotions bleed no more
i'll have chills at night
probably till i die
and feel a love reborn cuz...
you were my everything
you were my everything
the reason why i hoped and dreamed
you and i are a story untold
and now your gone
and my hearts turned cold
emotionally i was confused
but only for a second there
was i fooled
gave you all of me
every part of me
even sacrificed my precious jewel
then you patiently chipped away at me
using your words as tools
and i compromised my identity
and gave into me
just to play by your rules
you, you were my everything
you were my everything
the reason why i hoped and dreamed
you and i are a story untold
and now your gone
and my hearts turned cold
now that im free
i can release all that i have in me
all that ive held in for so long
wont let that keep me from moving on
now that im free
i can release all that i have in me
all that ive held in for so long
wont let that keep me from moving on
words of advice
speak from your heart
let the truth see you through
cuz what goes around
always comes around
and this could be you singing...
you were my everything
you were my everything
the reason why i hoped and dreamed
you and i are a story untold
and now your gone
and my hearts turned cold

We teach girls to shrink themselves
To make themselves smaller
We say to girls, you can have ambition
But not too much
You should aim to be successful but not too successful
Otherwise you will threaten the man
Because I am female
I am expected to aspire to marriage
I'm expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind
That marriage is the most important
Marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don't teach boys the same
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or accomplishments
Which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings
In the way that boys are
Feminist, a person who believes in the social
Political and economic equality of the sexes

Holding hands
She was standing there

Heard them promise
'Til death
Do us part
Each word
Was a pain
In my heart
All I could do
All I could do
Was cry
All I could do
Was cry
I was losing
The man
That I love
And all
I could do
Was cry
And now
The wedding
Is over
The rice
Rice has been thrown
Over their heads
For them life
Has just begun
But mine
Is ending

1173,Apathy,Beyonce,"
So what are you going to say at my funeral now that you killed me?
Here lies the body of the love of my life whose heart I broke
Without a gun to my head
Here lies the mother of my children, both living and dead
Rest in peace my true love who I took for granted
The most bomb pussy who because of me sleep evaded
Her shroud is loneliness
Her god was listening
Her heaven will be a love without betrayal
Ashes to ashes
Dust to sidechicks"
1174,Ave Maria,Beyonce,"She was lost in so many different ways
Out in the darkness with no guide
I know the cost of a losing hand
Never felt the grace of God, oh I
I found heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria
I've been alone when I'm surrounded by friends
How could the silence be so loud?
But I still go home knowing that I've got you
There's only us when the lights go down
You are my heaven on earth
You are my hunger, my thirst
I always hear this voice inside
Singing Ave Maria
Sometimes love can come and pass you by
While you're busy making plans
Suddenly hits you, and then you realise
It's out of your hands
Baby you've got to understand
You are my heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria
Ave Maria
Ave Maria"

What goes around comes back around (hey my baby)
I say what goes around comes back around (hey my baby)
What goes around comes back around
There was a time
I thought, that you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy I must've been out of my mind
So when I think of the time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and I, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
I thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you
So baby good lookin' out
I wanted you bad
I'm so through with that'
Cause honestly you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
You turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
And I'm gonna' always be the (best thing you never had)
Oh yeah, I bet it sucks to be you right now
So sad, you're hurt
Boo hoo, oh, did you expect me to care
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there
When I think that there was a time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and baby yes I saw the real you
Thank God you blew itI thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you
Baby good lookin' out
I wanted you bad
I'm so through with that
Cause honestly you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
I said, you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
And I'll never be the (best thing you never had)
Oh baby I bet sucks to be you right now
I know you want me back
It's time to face the facts
That I'm the one that's got away
Lord knows that it would take another place, another time, another world, another
life
Thank God I found the good in goodbye
I used to want you so bad
I'm so through with that
Cause honestly you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
Oh you turned out to be (the best thing I never had)
And I will always be the (best thing you never had)
Oh, best thing you never had
I used to want you so bad
I'm so through with that
Cause honestly you I don't wanna lose you,
But I don't wanna use you
Just to have somebody by my side
And I don't wanna hate you
I don't wanna take you
But I don't wanna be the one to cry
And that don't really matter
To anyone anymore
But like a fool I keep losing my place
And I keep seeing you walk through that door
But there's a danger
In loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know
It's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people
Don't stay where they are
Baby sometimes love just ain't enough
Now I could never change you
I don't wanna blame you
Baby you don't have to take the fall
(You don't have to take the fall)
Yes I may have hurt you
But I did not desert you
Maybe I just wanna have it all
It makes a sound like thunder
It makes me feel like rain
Like a fool who will never see the truth
I keep thinking something's gonna change
But there's a danger
In loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know
It's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people
Don't stay where they are
Baby sometimes love just ain't enough
And there's no way home
When it's late at night and you're all alone
Are there things that you wanted to say?
Do you feel me beside you in your bed?
There beside you, where I used to lay?
Oooh, oh, oh
Sometimes love just ain't enough
Oooh
There's a danger
In loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know
It's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people
Don't stay where they are
Baby sometimes love just ain't enough
Sometimes
Baby sometimes love, just ain't enough
Oooh, oh, mmmmm, mmmm

Ain't nothing like a thought you could have been
But still, you live inside of me
so tell me how is that
You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I love to not forgive
And though you break my heart you're the only one
And though there are times when I hate you
'Cause I can't erase the times that you hurt me
and put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you
It pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day
I don't wanna be without you babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you

I don't wanna love you
In no kind of way
No, no, I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken hearted girl
No, no, no broken hearted girl
I'm no broken hearted girl
There's something that I feel I need to say
But up to now I've always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I wanna put this out
You say you got the most respect for me
But sometimes I feel your not deservin' of me
And still, you're in my heart
But you're the only one
And yes, there are times when I hate you
But I don't complain
'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
Oh, but now, I don't hate you
I'm happy to say
that I will be there at the end of the day
I don't wanna be without you babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don't wanna love you
In no kind of way
No, no, I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken hearted girl
No, no, no broken hearted girl
Now I'm at a place
I thought I'd never be
ooh I'm living' in a world
that's all about you and me
Yeah, ain't gotta be afraid
my broken heart is free
To spread my wings
and fly away, away with you

I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you baby
I don't wanna play that part

Lined up my mind, on the grind, yeah, yeah

Pose like a trophy when Naomis walk in
She need an Oscar for that pretty dark skin
Pretty like Lupita when the cameras close in
Drip broke the levee when my Kellys roll in
I think tonight she might braid her braids
Melanin too dark to throw her shade
She minds her business and winds her waist
Gold like 24k, okay

Tonight I might fall in love, dependin' on how you hold me
I'm glad that I'm calmin' down, can't let no one come control me
Keep dancin' and call it love, she fightin' but fallin' slowly

Dig me like the earth, you be giving birth
Took everything in life, baby, know your worth
I love everything about you, from your nappy curls
To every single curve, your body natural
Same skin that was broken be the same skin takin' over
Most things out of focus, view
But when you're in the room, they notice you (Notice you)
'Cause you're beautiful
Yeah, you're beautiful
Them men, them gon' fall in love with you and all of your glory
Your skin is not only dark, it shines and it tells your story
Keep dancin', they can't control you
They watchin', they all adore you

1189,Can You Feel The Love Tonight,Beyonce,"
I can see what's happening (I can't, what?)
And they don't have a clue (Who's they?)
They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line
Our trio's down to two (Oh, I get it)
The sweet caress of twilight (Yep)
There's magic everywhere (It's everywhere)
And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disaster's in the air

Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things

So many things to tell her
But how to make her see
The truth about my past? Impossible
She'd turn away from me

He's holding back, he's hiding
But what, I can't decide
Why won't he be the king I know he is
The king I see inside?

Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things
Can you feel the love tonight?
You needn't look too far
Stealing through the night's uncertainties
Love is where they are

And if he falls in love tonight
It can be assumed
His carefree days with us are history
In short, our pal is doomed"

Hi hat (Uh)
808 (Uh)
Jay? (Uh-huh.)
Ready? (Uh-huh.)
Let's go get 'em (Uh-huh. C'mon.)
I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass, hi hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B (Boy you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me whippin' curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting
Stand back
Baby, seems like everywhere I go
I see you, from your eyes, your smile
It's like I breathe you, helplessly I reminisce
Don't want to compare nobody to you
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go
Oh
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Déjà Vu
Seeing things that I know can't be
Am I dreaming? When I saw you walking past me
Almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
It's like I'm losing it
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go, oh
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Déjà Vu
Yes! Hova's flow so unusual
Baby, girl you should already know
It's H-O, light up the strobe
'Cause you gon' need help tryna study my bounce, flow, blow
What's the difference?
One, you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dough, po-po try to convict him
That's a no-go
My dough keep the scales tippin' like 4-4's
Like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow, wind so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever, that's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits, like a factory
I'm just one-to-one, nothin' after me
No Déjà Vu, just me and my, Oh
Baby, I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having Déjà Vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missing you
That I'm having Déjà Vu
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go
Whoo...
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you

1200,Denial,Beyonce,"I tried to change
Closed my mouth more
Tried to be soft, prettier
Less... awake
Fasted for 60 days
Wore white
Abstained from mirrors
Abstained from sex
Slowly did not speak another word
And that time my hair I grew past my ankles
I slept on a mat on the floor
I swallowed a sword
I levitated
Into the basement
Confessed my sins
And was baptized in a river
Got on my knees and said, ""Amen""
And said, ""I mean""
I whipped my own back
And asked for dominion at your feet
I threw myself into a volcano
I drank the blood and drank the wine
I sat alone in begged and bent at the waist for God
I crossed myself in thought
I saw the devil
I grew thickened skin on my feet
I bathed in bleach
And plugged my menses with the pages from the holy book
But still inside me coiled deep was the need to know
Are you cheating?
Are you cheating on me?"
1201,Die With You,Beyonce,"I don't have a reason to cry
And I have every reason to smile
I don't have a reason to lie
When you're already reading my mind
And I don't have a reason to be, if I can't be with you
And I don't need air in my lungs, if I can't sing your song
No, I don't need hands if I don't get to keep you warm
And I don't really need myself, if I don't need you
Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you
I open my eyes so I could see with you
And I live so I can die with you
And I don't really need these fingers,
if I don't get to touch your spine
Well I don't need these legs,
if I ain't walking by your side
And I don't really need to be
f I can't be with you
Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you
I open my eyes so I could see with you
And I live so I can die with you
Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you
I open my eyes so I could see with you
And I live so I can die with you
I live so I can die with you"

Foreplay in the foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slip the panties right to the side

(I'm nice right now)
Hold up
That D'USSÉ is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up
Stumbled all in the house time to back up all of that mouth
That you had all in the car, talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be repping that third, I wanna see all the shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve
Foreplay in the foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slip the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take draws off, on site
Catch a charge I might, beat the box up like Mike
In '97 I bite, I'm Ike, Turner, turn up
Baby no I don't play, now eat the cake, Anna Mae
Said, ""Eat the cake, Anna Mae!""
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights you gonna need G3
4, 5, 6 flights, sleep tight
We sex again in the morning, your breastases is my breakfast
We going in, we be all night
Never tired, never tired
I been sipping, that's the only thing that's keeping me on fire, me on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinking watermelon
I want your body right here, daddy I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty

Could've been anywhere in the world but you're here with me
That's good for my ego, ha ha, me and my ego
And he go everywhere we go
My ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imagining
I had dreams of the league,
one day I'd play Kobe or walk up to Puff
and he would really know me.
Couldn't let the dream killers kill my self-esteem.
Or use the arrogance as the steam that power my dreams and my ego
It's on,

Daddy used to take me walkin' down the street
Daddy used to take my hand, say, ""Follow me""
Daddy used to leave me back home all the time
I got big enough to run around, Daddy left me outside

He said, ""Find your way back
Big, big world, but you got it, baby
Find your way back
Don't let this life drive you crazy
Find your way back
Come back home 'fore the street lights on
Find your way back
Find your way back""

Daddy used to tell me, ""Look up at the stars
It's been a long time, but remember who you are
Circle of life, but one day, I might not make it
Circle of life, but one day, I might not make it""

""But you just gotta find your way back
Big, big world, but you got it, baby
Find your way back
Don't let this life drive you crazy
Find your way back
Come back home 'fore the street lights on
Find your way back
Find your way back""

Daddy used to teach me all my moves
Runnin' 'round wild, had to tie my shoes
Itty bitty child with a smile like you
Wild, wild child, look a lot like you
Daddy used to teach me all my tricks
Runnin' 'round wild, had to get my fix
Daddy used to teach me all my plays
On a marathon, had to run my race

""Find your way back
Big, big world, but you got it, baby
Find your way back
Don't let this life drive you crazy
Find your way back
Come back home 'fore the street lights on
Find your way back
Find your way back, yeah""

We teach girls to shrink themselves
To make themselves smaller
We say to girls, you can have ambition
But not too much
You should aim to be successful but not too successful
Otherwise you will threaten the man
Because I am female
I am expected to aspire to marriage
I'm expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind
That marriage is the most important
Marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don't teach boys the same
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or accomplishments
Which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings
In the way that boys are
Feminist, a person who believes in the social
Political and economic equality of the sexes

When I walked away
And although I promised
That I couldn't stay baby

Don't work out that way

Dishes smashed on my counter
From our last encounter
Pictures snatched out the frame
Bitch I scratched out your name
And your face
What is it about you
That I can't erase baby
When every promise
Don't work out that way
When every promise
Don't work out that way
And your heart is broken
Cause I walked away

Won't you sing my body? I wanna let it out tonight
Wanna party, wanna dance, wanna be myself tonight
Baby, all I want is to let it go
Ain't no worries, no
We can dance all night
Get me bodied
That means ""come closer to me""
While we grind to the beat
And your body's touching my body
Baby, all I need is to let it be
Ain't no worry, no
Boy, dance with me
Feel my body
Stop, just come closer to me
While we grind to the beat
With your body touching my body
I'm the one tonight gettin' bodied
Ain't no shame 'cause I gotta get mine
I swing my hair and kick off my shoes
Come here, boy, lemme work on you
I ain't worried doing me tonight
A little sweat ain't never hurt nobody
While y'all standin' on the wall
I'm the one tonight getting bodied
Getting bodied, getting bodied, getting bodied, getting bodied
Want my body, won't you get me bodied?
If you want my body, won't you get me bodied? Hey"

How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cuz all the shit I hear is boring

Id worked for all my life
And I had to start again
With just my family by my side
Id thank my lucky stars, to be livin' here today
Cause the flag still stands for freedom,
and they cant take that away
And I'm proud to be an American
where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up
next to you and defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA
From the lakes of Minnesota to the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas, from sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston, to New York to L.A
Well there's pride in every American heart
and it's time to make a change
That I'm proud to be an American
where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
and who gave that right to me

What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you
Something don't feel right
Because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this?
Scrolling thru your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing? Maybe my head for one
What's worst, lookin' jealous or crazy?
Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately

For yourself of master wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride? No
They used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Babe, it's such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always give that top tier 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard
What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy?
Jealous and crazy?
Or like been walked all over lately, walked all over lately

Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude. It does not demand its own way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of being wronged. It does not rejoice about injustice but rejoices whenever the truth wins out. Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through every circumstance.
Beyonce:
I told you how your hurt me, baby
But you don't care
Now I'm crying and deserted, baby
But you don't care
Ain't nobody tell me this is love
But you're immune to all my pain
I need you to tell me this is love
You don't care, well that's okay
Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, la la la la la, la la la la la la
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, la la la la la, la la la la la la
Ever since you knew your power
You made me cry
And now everytime our love goes sour
You won't sympathize
You see these tears falling down to my ears
I swear you like when I'm in pain
I try to tell you all my fears
You still don't care? That's okay
Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, la la la la la, la la la la la la
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, la la la la la, la la la la la la
Boy, maybe if you cared enough
I wouldn't have to care so much
What happened to our trust?
Now you've just given up
You used to be so in love
Now you don't care no more
David Jassy:
Is it really love or is it just an illusion, or maybe you just going through a phase of confusion,
baby i still care even though you showing me the opposite,
I stay on top of it avoid the topic of apocalypse,
I've been monogamous locked in like shellfish,
while you've been acting like a fisherwoman...sell fish,
uh you're so immune to my pain,
either that or you just playing the game"
1234,I Miss You,Beyonce,"I thought that things like this get better with time
But I still need you, why is that?
You're the only image in my mind
So I still see you... around
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
Said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same
Words don't ever seem to come out right
But I still mean them, why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel
But I still need to, why is that?
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
I said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same
It don't matter who you are
It's so simple, I feel it
But it's everything no matter who you love
It is so simple, I feel it
But it's everything
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
I said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same
It don't matter who you are
It's so simple, I feel it
But it's everything no matter who you love
It is so simple, I feel it
But it's everything"
1235,I Was Here,Beyonce,"I wanna leave my footprints on the sands of time
Know there was something that, something that
I left behind
When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets
Leave something to remember
So they won't forget
I was here...
I lived, I loved
I was here...
I did, I've done, everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here...
I wanna say I lived each day, until I died
I know that I had something in somebody's life
The hearts I have touched, will be the proof that I leave
That I made a difference and this world will see
I was here...
I lived, I loved
I was here...
I did, I've done, everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark, so, everyone will know
I was here...
I lived, I loved
I was here...
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark, so, everyone will know
I was here...
I just want them to know
That I gave my all, did my best
Brought someone to happiness
Left this world little better just because...
I was here...
I was here...
I lived, I loved
I was here...
I did, I've done, everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark, so, everyone will know
I was here...
I lived, I loved
I was here...
I did, I've done
I was here...
I lived, I loved
I was here...
I did, I've done
I was here..."
1236,Id Rather Go Blind,Beyonce,"Something told me it was over (yeah)
When I saw you and her talking.
Something deep down in my soul said, ""Cry, girl."" (cry girl)
When I saw you and that girl walking around woo ooh.

I would rather,
I would rather go blind, boy,
Than to see you walk away from me, child, no, woo ooh.
So you see I love you so much
That I don't wanna watch you leave me, baby
Most of all I just don't,
I just don't wanna be free now, woo, ooh.
I was just, I was just, I was just sitting here thinking
Of your kiss and your warm embrace, yeah
When the reflection in a glass that I held to my lips now, baby
Revealed these tears that are all on my face, woo, ooh
And, baby, and, baby, baby,
I'd rather be blind, boy,
Than to see you walk away,
Walk away from me, yeah
"
1237,If I Were A Boy Girl,Beyonce,"If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home (to come home)
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong
But you're just a boy
You don't understand (Yeah, you don't understand)
How it feels to love a girl someday
You wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you're just a boy"

1240,Its All Over,Beyonce,"Effie, Curtis was supposed to...
Love me. Curtis was supposed to love me.
There you are Effie. I've been looking all over.
I turn my back and find myself out on the line. You could have warned me, but that would have been too kind!
I've been warning you for months to clean up your act. You've been late; you've been mean; given all kinds of bullshit flack.
That's a lie! That's a lie! It's just I haven't been feeling that well.
Effie, please. Stop excusing yourself. You've been late; you've been mean and getting fatter all the time.
Now you lying, you lying; I never been so thin. You lying, you lying, 'cause your knocking up that piece who thinks she's better than everybody. She ain't better than anybody, she ain't nothing but common!
Now who you callin' common you self-indulgent, self-absorbed and unprofessional...
You! I'm calling you, I'm calling you, the common piece is knocking off!
Now you listen to me, Miss Blame-It-On-The-World. See I put up with you for much too long. I have put up with your bitching, I've put up with your nagging, and all your screaming too!
Oh now when are you two gonna stop all this fighting?
Stay outta this Lorelle, this is between Deena and me!
Yeah, well it's between me too! I am as much a part of this group as anybody else! And I'm tired, Effie I'm tired, of all the problems you're making up!
I always knew you two were together!
What!
Always knew you two were ganging up on me!
She had nothing to do with this change. It was you! It was you always thinking of you. Always thinking of you!
I knew you were trouble from the start.
Trouble?
You were real bad trouble from the start!
Curtis, I'm your woman!
You're getting out now... I'm not building this group to have you tear it apart. Go ahead and rant and scream and shout. Don't worry baby, I'll buy you out.
There's no money dirty enough to buy me out. You remember that, Curtis.
Lay off Effie, just take the money and run.
You in this with them, C.C.?
Cool it Effie, this time you know what you've done!
So they've got your black ass too, huh?
I said cool it Effie, this time you've gone too far.
Oh I can go further, I can go further!
I don't wanna stay around this. I'm just breaking into this business. This is between all of you. This is none of my affair.
Yeah? Well it's between you too now, little sister. This small job is just as much your sin. Look at me, look at me! How much did you put out to get in?
Now you watch your mouth, watch your mouth, Ms. Effie White. 'Cause I don't take that talk from no second-rate diva, who can't sustain.
I'm not feeling well. I've got pains.
Effie, we all got pains!
Oh! For seven years I sung with you, I was your sister!
You were a trouble.
Now you're telling me it's all over?
And now we're telling you: it's all over.
And now I'm telling you, I ain't going!
It's all over.
I ain't going!
It's all over."

And I know that I'm not honest

Take it one step further
Freakum dress out of my closet
Yonce filling out this skirt

And I aint missed a beat

To find release
Oh, the time has come
For my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own
All cause you won't
Listen
Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home, in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known
Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own
You should have listened
There is someone here inside
Someone I'd thought had died
So long ago
Oh, I'm screaming out, and my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or worked
Into your own
All cause you won't
Listen
Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home, in my own home

To say what's on my mind

But nine times outta ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
All the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough
Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought
Nine times out of ten, I'm in my feelings
But ten times out of nine, I'm only human
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Feel like that question has been posed
I'm movin' on
I'll always be committed, I been focused
I always paid attention, been devoted
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Oh, already asked that, my bad

'Cause you're the one I love
Baby, you're the one I need
You're the only one I see
Baby, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one that always calls
When I need you, everything stops"
1247,Mine,Beyonce,"I been watching for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind, oh
Now I'm even more lost
You're still so fine
All mine...
All mine...
Been having conversations about break-ups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oh
'Cause if we are
We're taking this a little too far...
If we are...
We're taking this a little too far...
Baby if we are...
We're taking this a little too far...
With me being wherever I'm at
Worrying about wherever you are
We're taking this a little too...
Far...
We're taking this a little too...
Far...
We're taking this a little too...

Know you wanna roll with a good girl
Do it big do it all for a good girl

This is a song for the good girl
Don't sleep when you know you got a good girl
One time...
This is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll wanna roll with a good girl

And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
What's up
On my mind, I pass my bed time
No rest at the kingdom...
Alone in my place, my heart is away
All that I can think of is...
We should get married, we should get married
Let's stop holding back on this and let's get carried away
Stop making a big deal out of the little things,
Cause I got big deals and I got little things
I got everything I'm asking for but you...
Stop making a big deal out of the little things,
Let's get carried away...
Come right now you know where I stay...
I just wanna say your mine, your mine

Fuck what they heard your mine, your mine
All I'm really asking for is you...
Your mine, your mine
I just wanna say your mine, your mine
Fuck what they heard your mine, your mine
Long as you know who you belong to...
Know you wanna roll with a good girl
Do it big do it all for a good girl

Don't sleep when you know you got a good girl

This is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll wanna roll with a good girl

And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
What's up
Oh... from 8 until late I think bout you
You're on my nights I don't know what to do
I can't get no rest, can't get no sleep
This whole thing got way to deep and we should
Stop making a big deal out of the little things,
Cause I got big deals and I got little things
I got everything I'm asking for but you...
Stop making a big deal out of the little things,
Let's get carried away...

1251,Never Let You Go,Beyonce,"My mind has been blown to bits
I was just about to call it quits
An everyday problem
I didn't stand a prayer
And you came along
And hope was there
There have been times
When I thought that I
Could turn right up and
Break down and cry
You gave me your hand
You made me stand
You said, be a man
Yes, I know you can
And each and every day
You never failed to say
With me, always stay
Please don't go away
And in return
You know I never will
You know I never will
Yes, I never will, oh, oh
Never, never let you go
(Never let you go, baby)
(Never let you go, baby)
(Never let you go, baby)
(Never let you, no, never, never)
(Never) never (let you go)
I count raindrops on a rainy day
Just keep you, my love
From walking away
I want you to understand
I do whatever I can
Just to stay your man
I'm in love
Cause each and every day
You never failed to say
With me, always stay
Please don't go away
And in return
You know I never will
You know I never will
You know I never, never
Never, never, never, never

Because you're no angel either, baby
Cause you're no angel either, baby
You're not an angel either
But at least I'm trying
I know i drive you crazy
But would you rather that i be a machine
Who doesn't notice when you're late or when you're lyin'
I love you even more than who I thought you were before
Cause you're no angel either, baby

Stop actin' so scared, just do what I tell
First both my legs go back on your head
And whatever you want, yeah baby I bet
(It comes true) Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm the problem
No I'm not the girl you thought you
Knew and thought you wanted
Underneath that pretty face is something complicated

You got the swag sauce, you dripping swag goo, ooh
I may be young but I'm ready
To give you all my love
I told my girls you can get it
Don't slow it down, just let it go
So in love, I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
So tonight, I'll do it every way
Speakers knocking 'til the morning light
'Cause we like to party
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
'Cause we like to party
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
'cause we like to party
Your touch is driving me crazy
I can't explain the way I feel
Top down with the radio on
And the night belongs to us
Just hold me close, don't let me go
So in love, I don't care what they say
I don't care if they talking tomorrow
'Cause tonight's the night, oh oh
That I give you everything, music
knocking 'til the morning light
'Cause we like to party
Set the scene, three thousand degrees
Ain't worried 'bout them
But they worry 'bout me
I got a homeboy named Butta
And another homeboy there named Cheese
with me, baby, I make it milk
'Til it drip down yo' knees
Spit this shit for rillo
Brain Brillo
Kiddo say he looks up to me
This just makes me feel old
Never thought that we could become
Someone else's hero
Man, we were just in the food court
Eating our gyros
Yesterday, that's the way
Every single morning I try to pray
Grandmom an' 'em, they never forgot
Nothing else really mean nothing to me
I ain't stunting to beat
Talking to me?
Girl, why you with me?
Move on, ain't nothing to see
Psst, always something to salt
I'm the raw off the rip
'Cause of him, all of them
Will remember the men
And that they fell in love with rap
Black like having your cousin back
Blue like when that rent is due
Cream like when I'm loving you, yeah
So in love, I'd give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
'Cause tonight's the night, oh oh
That I give you everything, music knocking 'til the morning light
'Cause we like to party
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
'Cause we like to party
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, we like to party
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh
You got the swag sauce, you dripping swag goo
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh
You got the swag sauce, you dripping swag goo, ooh"
1257,Pray You Catch Me,Beyonce,"You can taste the dishonesty, it's all over your breath
As you pass it off so cavalier, but even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all, my lonely ear
Pressed against the walls of your world
Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray you catch me
Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory, it don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern, but I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb
Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me
I pray you catch me
Pray you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me
What are you doing, my love?"
1258,Pretty Hurts,Beyonce,"Mama said, you're a pretty girl
What's in your head it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters
Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down
Pretty hurts
Shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is the disease of a nation
Pretty hurts
Shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery
Blonder hair, flat chest
TV says bigger is better
South beach, sugar free
Vogue says
Thinner is better
Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down
Pretty hurts
Shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is the disease of a nation
Pretty hurts
Shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery
Ain't no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pain's inside
And nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul, it's the soul that needs surgery
It's my soul that needs surgery
Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
Then you break when the fake facade leaves you in the dark
You left a shattered mirror
And the shards of a beautiful girl
Pretty hurts
Shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is the disease of a nation
Pretty hurts
Shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery
When you'r alone all by yourself
And you're lying in your bed
Reflection stares right into you
Are you happy with yourself
It's just a way to masquerade
The illusion has been shed
Are you happy with yourself
Are you happy with yourself
Yes"
1259,Ratchet,Beyonce,"World once seemed still, till you came around
Bringing all my emotions unbound
You unlocked my soul and rocked my Universe
Whoa, ohhh-o-o-ohh
You are some kind of a dream
Some kind of wild imagination machine
Take me, ratchet me around
Open my heart
Speak our truth
Together we unwind like a corkscrew
I love you"
1260,Rather Die Young,Beyonce,"Boy, you'll be the death of me
You're my James Dean
You make me feel like I'm seventeen
You drive too fast
You smoke too much
But that don't mean a thing cause I'm addicted to the rush
Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than life my life without you
Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than life my life without you
You know I've been in love before
You're the first one I've ever seen that burns like gasoline
So light a match, turn off the lights
I'm holding on to you cause this might be our last night
Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than life my life without you
Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than life my life without you
What I'm telling you
I'm giving you my life, it's in your hands
And what I'm gonna do
Is be a woman and you can be a man
And I wanna say
Nobody understands what we've been through
I'd rather give up everything
Than to live my, live my life without you
Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than life my life without you
Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than life my life without you"
1261,Resentment,Beyonce,"I wish I could believe you
Then I'd be alright
But now everything you told me
Really don't apply
To the way I feel inside
Loving you was easy
Once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you
Have multiplied
And it's all because you lied
I only give you a hard time
Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment
Just can't seem to get over
The way you hurt me
I don't know how you gave another
Who didn't mean a thing no
Everything you gave to me
I thought I could forgive you
And I know you've changed
As much as I wanna trust you
I know it ain't the same
And it's all because you lied
I only give you a hard time
Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment
I may never understand why
I'm doing the best that I can and I,
I've tried and I've tried to forget this
I'm much too full of resentment (you lied)
I'll always remember feeling (you lied)
Like I was no good (you lied)
Like I couldn't do it for you (you lied)
Like your mistress could
And it's all because you lied
Loved you more than ever (you lied)
More than my own life (you lied)
The best part of me I gave you (you lied)
It was sacrificed
And it's all because you lied
I only give you a hard time
Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I've tried and I've tried to forget this
I'm too damn full of resentment
I know she was attractive but I was here first
I been riding with you for 6 years
Why did I deserve
To be treated this way by you
I know you prolly thinking
What's up wit ""B""
I've been crying for too long
What did you do to me
I used to be so strong
Now you took my soul
I'm crying I can't stop crying
Can't stop crying
You could've told me
You was unhappy
I know you didn't wanna hurt me
But look what you done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes (you lied)
And see she's had half of me (you lied)
How could you lie (you lied)"
1262,Ring Off,Beyonce,"Mama, I understand your many sleepless nights
When you sit and you think about Father
Or how you tried to be the perfect twice
You used to dress and fix your hair
Then you smiled through your tears
In the mirror you would stare
And say a prayer
Like ""I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart""
Until you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off
Mama (so sexy), you live and learn, that's just the way life goes
(Uh, you a killer, you a killer, killer)
Always know that you've got a daughter
That's so, so proud you took the high road
(You a killer, so sexy)
You used to dress and fix your hair
You always smiled through your tears
In the mirror you would stare
And say a prayer
Like ""I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart""
Until you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off
After all your tears
After all that pain's all clear
Mama, after all them years
We can start all over again
Mama, and now it all makes sense
Letting go is never the end
Mama, we can love again
This is where freedom begins
Mama, so put your love on top
You gon' shine and put your love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Everybody put your love on top
Aye, love on top
Aye, love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Girl you so fine, put your love on top
If you're going through it just know it's called ""going through it""
You're not gonna get stuck there, you're not gonna die
You're gonna survive"
1263,Rise Up,Beyonce,"I'm the matriarch of your land
When you need to take my hand
Come into my arms, I'll keep you safe from harm
I'll keep your precious heart
Some people try to drag you down
Take it from me, stand and be proud
You're a warrior
You're my warrior
Be who you are
Be who you are
Know that life holds more than what you see
Rise up little man, rise up little man
Fight for you and me
Look into my eyes and believe
Little woman we will fight, we will fight
Little woman we will fight, we will rise
I see you and me
Take my hand and we
We will stand, we will fight, we will fight
We will stand and together we will rise
They'll burn you at the stake if you
Don't act like they want you to
But baby be yourself
Do good and help the world
Be who you are
Be who you are
Know that life holds more than what you see
Rise up little man, rise up little man
Fight for you and me
Look into my eyes and believe
Little woman we will fight, we will fight
Little woman we will fight, we will rise
I see you and me
Take my hand and we
We will stand, we will fight, we will fight
We will stand and together we will rise
Rise up, rise up little man
Don't be scared I'm holding your hand
Know that life holds more than
What we see and what we get
Rise up, rise up little woman
Don't be afraid to risk it all
Know that life holds more than
What we see and what we get, I will
Fight for you and me
Look into my eyes and believe
Little woman we will fight, we will fight
Little woman we will fight, we will rise
I see you and me
Take my hand and we
We will stand, we will fight, we will fight
We will stand and together we will rise"

Bitch, I scratched out your name and your face
What is it about you that I can't erase, baby?
Well every promise don't work out that way, no no, babe
Well every promise don't work out that way
And your heart is broken cause I walked away

1279,Start Over,Beyonce,"I feel weak, we've been here before
Cuz I feel weak, keep going back and forth
Maybe it's over, maybe we're through
But I honestly can say
I still love you
Maybe we reached the mountain peak
And there's no more left to climb
And maybe we lost the magic peace
And we're both too blind to find
Let's start over
Let's give love the wings
Let's start over
Stop fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over
We can't let our good love die
Maybe we can start over
Give love another life
I can see that we're not happy here
So why won't we keep pretending that there's nothing there
Maybe you like it, but I don't
And maybe you said so, well I won't
Maybe we reached the mountain peak
And there's no more left to climb
And maybe we lost the magic peace
And we're both too blind to find
Let's start over
Let's give love the wings
Let's start over
Stop fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over
We can't let our good love die
Maybe we can start over
Give love another life
I know that this will hurt you
I know you'll cry
I know I called you selfish but that's a lie
I feel I know that's the best for us
Let's start over!
Let's give love the wings
Let's start over
I'm tired of fighting 'bout the same old thing
Let's start over
We know that this love won't die
Maybe we can start over
Give love another life"

1281,Superpower,Beyonce,"When the palm of my two hands hold each other
That feels different
From when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is
And when my voice is screaming out to my own ears
That feels different from when I hear yours
Now that's just the way it is
And when I'm standing in this mirror after all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show you
I guess I didn't see myself before you
Moving forward
(Superpower) A subtle power
(Superpower) A tough love
(Superpower) Like a shark
(Superpower) Like a bear, a tough love
And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
Cause nothing I know can break us down
They can't break us down
And just like you I can be scared
Just like you I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there: tough love (superpower)
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky
And what falls, it's a superpower (superpower)
The laws of the world never stopped us once
Cause together we got plenty superpower
(Superpower) A subtle power
(Superpower) A tough love
(Superpower) Like a shark
(Superpower) Too much to bear
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down

Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe
I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes
I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale
Can you hold my hands
And be my guide?
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?
You can be a sweet dream
Or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you

1283,The Star Spangled Banner,Beyonce,"O say can you see by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro' the perilous fight
O're the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still there
O say, does that star spangled banner yet wave
O're the land of the free and the home of the brave."
1284,Till The End Of Time,Beyonce,"Oooooooh... if I should die tomorrow
Oh please let there let there be life

Puffing on the mids
