0,'Bart Simpson','Princess Nokia',"Rotten apple to the core
Damn, I been a fuck up
Getting picked for last in gym
I can't even do a lay up
Writing on my sneakers
Being sneaky with my teachers
Smoking weed under the bleachers
Cutting out and glueing pictures
Carrying my CD player
Sucking on a Now or Later
Sour Apple was the flavor
Scribbling on doodle paper
Trying hard to pay attention
But I have no real direction
So I say, ""yo, fuck this lesson""
Spark the leaf, my back is stressing
Who I am and where I'm headed
Cutting school and acting crazy
Foster care done got me crazy
Living with a crazy lady"

3,'Goat','Princess Nokia',"Hate to burst your bubble, bitch
I'm that weird girl that's runnin' shit
I'm a boss bitch runnin' big shit
Got a company, need a couple mil'
Ain't no rap talk, this my real life
And that's on God, I almost died twice
So I go 'head, and I get mine
And I cash checks, and I get fly
Pelle Pelle with the VB belt
Skinny jeans and a studded belt
I've been fly, never needed help
I been me, ain't nobody else
Skinny jeans and a pair of Vans
Pants sag 'til they hit my ass
Lit, lit, I'ma do my dance
Like a raver bitch goin' in a trance
Edru, I'm a skater boy
Anime and a lot of tours
MySpace, made a lot of noise
That's middle school and I'm actin' caught
Back of the class, they sending my ass
Roll up my skirt and they think that I'm fast
I got no ass and I got no titties
But all of your dudes, they hit me to hit me"

Oh my God"
7,'Saggy Denim','Princess Nokia',"[Chorus: Princess Nokia]

In my Tommy boxers or my Calvin Klein
Ooh baby, ooh baby, I love to get fly"
